Notes

* Comparison with Org Agenda searches::
* org-sidebar::

This package provides a query language for Org files.  It offers two
syntax styles: Lisp-like sexps and search engine-like keywords.

   It includes three libraries: The org-ql library is flexible and may
be used as a backend for other tools.  The libraries org-ql-search and
helm-org-ql provide interactive search commands and saved views.

3 Installation
**************

The package may be installed directly from MELPA
(https://melpa.org/#/org-ql) or with other tools like Quelpa
(https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa).

   After installation, you can use the commands without additional
configuration.  _Note: The command helm-org-ql only works if the package
helm-org is installed; Helm is not a dependency of this package, so it’s
not automatically installed._

   To use the functions and macros in your own Elisp code, use libraries
org-ql and org-ql-view.

4.1.1 org-ql-search
-------------------

_Note: This command supports both sexp queries and ._

   Read ‘QUERY’ and search with ‘org-ql’.  Interactively, prompt for
these variables:

   ‘BUFFERS-FILES’: ‘A’ list of buffers and/or files to search.
Interactively, may also be:

   • ‘buffer’: search the current buffer
   • ‘all’: search all Org buffers
   • ‘agenda’: search buffers returned by the function
     ‘org-agenda-files’
   • An expression which evaluates to a list of files/buffers
   • A space-separated list of file or buffer names

   ‘GROUPS’: An ‘org-super-agenda’ group set.  See variable
‘org-super-agenda-groups’.

   ‘NARROW’: When non-nil, don’t widen buffers before searching.
Interactively, with prefix, leave narrowed.

   ‘SORT’: One or a list of ‘org-ql’ sorting functions, like ‘date’ or
‘priority’.

   *Bindings:* Keys bound in results buffer.
   • r: Refresh results.  With prefix, prompt to adjust search
     parameters.
   • v: Show transient view dispatcher (like Magit’s popups).
   • C-x C-s: Save query to variable ‘org-ql-views’ (accessible with
     command ‘org-ql-view’).

   *Note:* The view buffer is currently put in ‘org-agenda-mode’, which
means that _some_ Org Agenda commands work, such as jumping to entries
and changing item priorities (without necessarily updating the view).
This feature is experimental and not guaranteed to work correctly with
all commands.  (It works to the extent it does because the appropriate
text properties are placed on each item, imitating an Agenda buffer.)

4.1.2 helm-org-ql
-----------------

_Note: This command uses ._

   This command displays matches with Helm.  *Note:* Helm is not a
package dependency, so this command only works if the package helm-org
is installed.

   • Press C-x C-s in the Helm session to save the results to an
     org-ql-search buffer.


File: README.info,  Node: org-ql-view,  Next: org-ql-view-sidebar,  Prev: helm-org-ql,  Up: Commands

4.1.3 org-ql-view
-----------------

Choose and display a view stored in ‘org-ql-views’.

   *Bindings:* Keys bound in view buffer.
   • g, r: Refresh results.  With prefix, prompt to adjust search
     parameters.
   • v: Show transient view dispatcher (like Magit’s popups).
   • C-x C-s: Save query to variable ‘org-ql-views’ (accessible with
     command ‘org-ql-view’).

4.1.4 org-ql-view-sidebar
-------------------------

Show a sidebar window listing views stored in org-ql-views for easy
access.  In the sidebar, press RET or mouse-1 to show the view at point,
and press c to customize the view at point.


File: README.info,  Node: org-ql-view-recent-items,  Next: org-ql-sparse-tree,  Prev: org-ql-view-sidebar,  Up: Commands

4.1.5 org-ql-view-recent-items
------------------------------

Show items in ‘FILES’ from last ‘DAYS’ days with timestamps of ‘TYPE’.
‘TYPE’ may be ‘ts’, ‘ts-active’, ‘ts-inactive’, ‘clocked’, ‘closed’,
‘deadline’, ‘planning’, or ‘scheduled’.  FILES defaults to those
returned by the function org-agenda-files.


File: README.info,  Node: org-ql-sparse-tree,  Prev: org-ql-view-recent-items,  Up: Commands

4.1.6 org-ql-sparse-tree
------------------------

Arguments: ‘(query &key keep-previous (buffer (current-buffer)))’

   Show a sparse tree for ‘QUERY’ in ‘BUFFER’ and return number of
results.  The tree will show the lines where the query matches, and any
other context defined in ‘org-show-context-detail’, which see.

   ‘QUERY’ is an ‘org-ql’ query sexp (quoted, since this is a function).
‘BUFFER’ defaults to the current buffer.  When ‘KEEP-PREVIOUS’ is
non-nil (interactively, with prefix), the outline is not reset to the
overview state before finding matches, which allows stacking calls to
this command.  Runs ‘org-occur-hook’ after making the sparse tree.

4.2 Queries
===========

   • • • • 
   An org-ql query is a lisp form which may contain arbitrary lisp
forms, as well as certain built-in predicates.  It is byte-compiled into
a predicate function which is tested with point on each heading in an
Org buffer; when it returns non-nil, the heading matches the query.

   *Notes:*
   • Bare strings like ‘"string"’ are automatically converted to
     ‘(regexp "string")’ predicates.
   • Standard numeric comparator function symbols (‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>’, ‘>=’,
     ‘=’ ) need not be quoted when passed as an argument to predicates
     which accept them.  The resemblance to infix notation is
     coincidental.

4.2.1 Non-sexp query syntax
---------------------------

The command org-ql-search also accepts, and the command helm-org-ql only
accepts, an alternative, non-sexp query syntax.  The syntax is simple,
and a few examples of queries in both syntaxes should suffice.  By
default, when multiple predicates are used, they are combined with
boolean and.

Sexp syntax                                         Non-sexp syntax
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘(todo)’                                            ‘todo:’
‘(todo "SOMEDAY")’                                  ‘todo:SOMEDAY’
‘(todo "SOMEDAY" "WAITING")’                        ‘todo:SOMEDAY,WAITING’
‘(ts :on today)’                                    ‘ts:on=today’
‘(ts-active :from "2017-01-01" :to "2018-01-01")’   ‘ts-active:from=2017-01-01,to=2018-01-01’
‘(clocked :on -1)’                                  ‘clocked:on=-1’
‘(heading "quoted phrase" "word")’                  ‘heading:"quoted phrase",word’
‘(and (tags "book" "books") (priority "A"))’        ‘tags:book,books priority:A’
‘(src :lang "elisp" :regexps ("defun"))’            ‘src:defun,lang=elisp’ or ‘src:lang=elisp,defun’
‘(and (tags "space") (not (regexp "moon")))’        ‘tags:space !moon’
‘(priority >= B)’                                   ‘priority:A,B’

   Note that the priority predicate does not support comparators in the
non-sexp syntax, so multiple priorities should be passed instead, as
seen in the last example.


File: README.info,  Node: General predicates,  Next: Ancestor/descendant predicates,  Prev: Non-sexp query syntax,  Up: Queries

4.2.2 General predicates
------------------------

Arguments are listed next to predicate names, where applicable.

‘category (&optional categories)’
     Return non-nil if current heading is in one or more of ‘CATEGORIES’
     (a list of strings).
‘done’
     Return non-nil if entry’s ‘TODO’ keyword is in ‘org-done-keywords’.
‘habit’
     Return non-nil if entry is a habit.
‘heading (&rest regexps)’
     Return non-nil if current entry’s heading matches all ‘REGEXPS’
     (regexp strings).
        • Aliases: h.
‘level (level-or-comparator &optional level)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s outline level matches
     arguments.  The following forms are accepted: ‘(level NUMBER)’:
     Matches if heading level is ‘NUMBER’.  ‘(level NUMBER NUMBER)’:
     Matches if heading level is equal to or between NUMBERs.  ‘(level
     COMPARATOR NUMBER)’: Matches if heading level compares to ‘NUMBER’
     with ‘COMPARATOR’.  ‘COMPARATOR’ may be ‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>’, or ‘>=’.
‘link (&optional description-or-target &key description target regexp-p)’
     Return non-nil if current heading contains a link matching
     arguments.  ‘DESCRIPTION-OR-TARGET’ is matched against the link’s
     description and target.  Alternatively, one or both of
     ‘DESCRIPTION’ and ‘TARGET’ may be matched separately.  Without
     arguments, return non-nil if any link is found.
‘outline-path (&rest strings)’
     Return non-nil if current node’s outline path matches all of
     ‘STRINGS’.  Each string may appear as a substring in any part of
     the node’s outline path.  For example, the path Food/Fruits/Grapes
     would match ‘(olp "Fruit" "Grape")’.
        • Aliases: ‘olp’.
‘outline-path-segment (&rest strings)’
     Return non-nil if current node’s outline path matches ‘STRINGS’.
     Matches ‘STRINGS’ as a contiguous segment of the outline path.
     Each string is compared as a substring.  For example the path
     ‘Food/Fruits/Grapes’ would match ‘(olps "Fruit" "Grape")’ but not
     ‘(olps "Food" "Grape")’.
        • Aliases: ‘olps’.
‘path (&rest regexps)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s buffer’s filename path matches
     any of ‘REGEXPS’ (regexp strings).  Without arguments, return
     non-nil if buffer is file-backed.
‘priority (&rest args)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has a certain priority.  ‘ARGS’
     may be either a list of one or more priority letters as strings, or
     a comparator function symbol followed by a priority letter string.
     For example: ‘(priority "A") (priority "A" "B") (priority '>= "B")’
     Note that items without a priority cookie never match this
     predicate (while Org itself considers items without a cookie to
     have the default priority, which, by default, is equal to priority
     ‘B’).
‘property (property &optional value)’
     Return non-nil if current entry has ‘PROPERTY’ (a string), and
     optionally ‘VALUE’ (a string).  Note that property inheritance is
     currently _not_ enabled for this predicate.  If you need to test
     with inheritance, you could use a custom predicate form, like
     ‘(org-entry-get (point) "PROPERTY" 'inherit)’.
‘regexp (&rest regexps)’
     Return non-nil if current entry matches all of ‘REGEXPS’ (regexp
     strings).  Matches against entire entry, from beginning of its
     heading to the next heading.
        • Aliases: r.
‘‘src (&key lang regexps)’’
     Return non-nil if current entry contains an Org Babel source block.
     If ‘LANG’ is non-nil, match blocks of that language.  If ‘REGEXPS’
     is non-nil, require that block’s contents match all regexps.
‘tags (&optional tags)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has one or more of ‘TAGS’ (a list
     of strings).  Tests both inherited and local tags.
‘tags-inherited (&optional tags)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s inherited tags include one or
     more of ‘TAGS’ (a list of strings).  If ‘TAGS’ is nil, return
     non-nil if heading has any inherited tags.
        • Aliases: ‘inherited-tags’, ‘tags-i’, ‘itags’.
‘tags-local (&optional tags)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s local tags include one or more
     of ‘TAGS’ (a list of strings).  If ‘TAGS’ is nil, return non-nil if
     heading has any local tags.
        • Aliases: ‘local-tags’, ‘tags-l’, ‘ltags’.
‘tags-all (tags)’
     Return non-nil if current heading includes all of ‘TAGS’.  Tests
     both inherited and local tags.
        • Aliases: ‘tags&’.
‘todo (&optional keywords)’
     Return non-nil if current heading is a ‘TODO’ item.  With
     ‘KEYWORDS’, return non-nil if its keyword is one of ‘KEYWORDS’ (a
     list of strings).  When called without arguments, only matches
     non-done tasks (i.e.  does not match keywords in
     ‘org-done-keywords’).


File: README.info,  Node: Ancestor/descendant predicates,  Next: Date/time predicates,  Prev: General predicates,  Up: Queries

4.2.3 Ancestor/descendant predicates
------------------------------------

‘ancestors (&optional query)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has ancestor headings.  If
     ‘QUERY’, return non-nil if an ancestor heading matches it.  This
     selector may be nested.
‘children (&optional query)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has direct child headings.  If
     ‘QUERY’, return non-nil if a child heading matches it.  This
     selector may be nested, e.g.  to match grandchild headings.
‘descendants (&optional query)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has descendant headings.  If
     ‘QUERY’, return non-nil if a descendant heading matches it.  This
     selector may be nested (if you can grok the nesting!).
‘parent (&optional query)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has a direct parent heading.  If
     ‘QUERY’, return non-nil if the parent heading matches it.  This
     selector may be nested, e.g.  to match grandparent headings.


File: README.info,  Node: Date/time predicates,  Prev: Ancestor/descendant predicates,  Up: Queries

4.2.4 Date/time predicates
--------------------------

All of these predicates take optional keyword arguments ‘:from’, ‘:to:’,
and ‘:on’:

   • If ‘:from’, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on or after
     ‘:from’.
   • If ‘:to’, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on or before
     ‘:to’.
   • If ‘:on’, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on date ‘:on’.

   Argument values should be either a number of days (positive to look
forward, or negative to look backward), a ‘ts’ struct, or a string
parseable by ‘parse-time-string’ (the string may omit the time value).

   • *Predicates*
     ‘ts’
          Return non-nil if current entry has a timestamp in given
          period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if
          entry has any timestamp.
     ‘ts-active, ts-a’
          Like ts, but only matches active timestamps.
     ‘ts-inactive, ts-i’
          Like ts, but only matches inactive timestamps.

   The following predicates, in addition to the keyword arguments, can
also take a single argument, a number, which looks backward or forward a
number of days.  The number can be negative to invert the direction.

   • *Backward-looking*
     ‘clocked’
          Return non-nil if current entry was clocked in given period.
          If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry was
          clocked at any time.  Note: Clock entries are expected to be
          clocked out.  Currently clocked entries (i.e.  with unclosed
          timestamp ranges) are ignored.
     ‘closed’
          Return non-nil if current entry was closed in given period.
          If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry was
          closed at any time.

   • *Forward-looking*
     ‘deadline’
          Return non-nil if current entry has deadline in given period.
          If argument is auto, return non-nil if entry has deadline
          within org-deadline-warning-days.  If no arguments are
          specified, return non-nil if entry has any deadline.
     ‘planning’
          Return non-nil if current entry has planning timestamp in
          given period (i.e.  its deadline, scheduled, or closed
          timestamp).  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if
          entry is scheduled at any time.
     ‘scheduled’
          Return non-nil if current entry is scheduled in given period.
          If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry is
          scheduled at any time.

File: README.info,  Node: Agenda-like views,  Next: Listing / acting-on results,  Up: Functions / Macros

4.3.1 Agenda-like views
-----------------------

  1. Function: ‘org-ql-block’

     For use as a custom agenda block type in
     ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  For example, you could define a
     custom series command like this, which would list all priority A
     items tagged Emacs with to-do keyword SOMEDAY, followed by the
     standard agenda view, in a single buffer:

          (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
                '(("ces" "Custom: Agenda and Emacs SOMEDAY [#A] items"
                   ((org-ql-block '(and (todo "SOMEDAY")
                                        (tags "Emacs")
                                        (priority "A"))
                                  ((org-ql-block-header "SOMEDAY :Emacs: High-priority")))
                    (agenda)))))

     Which would be equivalent to a ‘tags-todo’ search like this:

          (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
                '(("ces" "Custom: Agenda and Emacs SOMEDAY [#A] items"
                   ((tags-todo "PRIORITY=\"A\"+Emacs/!SOMEDAY")
                    (agenda)))))

     However, the ‘org-ql-block’ version runs in about 1/5th the time.

     The variable org-ql-block-header may be bound to a string to use as
     the block header, otherwise the header is formed automatically.


File: README.info,  Node: Listing / acting-on results,  Prev: Agenda-like views,  Up: Functions / Macros

4.3.2 Listing / acting-on results
---------------------------------

  1. Function: ‘org-ql-select’

     _Arguments:_ ‘(buffers-or-files query &key action narrow sort)’

     Return items matching ‘QUERY’ in ‘BUFFERS-OR-FILES’.

     ‘BUFFERS-OR-FILES’ is a one or a list of files and/or buffers.

     ‘QUERY’ is an ‘org-ql’ query sexp (quoted, since this is a
     function).

     ‘ACTION’ is a function which is called on each matching entry with
     point at the beginning of its heading.  It may be:

        • ‘element’ or nil: Equivalent to ‘org-element-headline-parser’.

        • ‘element-with-markers’: Equivalent to calling
          ‘org-element-headline-parser’, with markers added using
          ‘org-ql--add-markers’.  Suitable for formatting with
          ‘org-ql-agenda--format-element’, allowing insertion into an
          Org Agenda-like buffer.

        • A sexp, which will be byte-compiled into a lambda function.

        • A function symbol.

     If ‘NARROW’ is non-nil, buffers are not widened (the default is to
     widen and search the entire buffer).

     ‘SORT’ is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or
     a list of defined ‘org-ql’ sorting methods (‘date’, ‘deadline’,
     ‘scheduled’, ‘todo’, ‘priority’, or ‘random’); or a user-defined
     comparator function that accepts two items as arguments and returns
     nil or non-nil.

     Examples:

          ;; Return list of to-do headings in inbox file with tags and to-do keywords:
          (org-ql-select "~/org/inbox.org"
            '(todo)
            :action #'org-get-heading)
          ;; => ("TODO Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound  :personal:" ...)

          ;; Without tags and to-do keywords:
          (org-ql-select "~/org/inbox.org"
            '(todo)
            :action '(org-get-heading t t))
          ;; => ("Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound" ...)

          ;; Return WAITING heading elements in agenda files:
          (org-ql-select (org-agenda-files)
            '(todo "WAITING")
            :action 'element)
          ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

          ;; Since `element' is the default for ACTION, it may be omitted:
          (org-ql-select (org-agenda-files)
            '(todo "WAITING"))
          ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

  2. Function: ‘org-ql-query’

     _Arguments:_ ‘(&key (select 'element-with-markers) from where
     order-by narrow)’

     Like ‘org-ql-select’, but arguments are named more like a ‘SQL’
     query.

        • ‘SELECT’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument ‘ACTION’.
        • ‘FROM’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument
          ‘BUFFERS-OR-FILES’.
        • ‘WHERE’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument ‘QUERY’.
        • ‘ORDER-BY’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument ‘SORT’,
          which see.
        • ‘NARROW’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument ‘NARROW’.

     Examples:

          ;; Return list of to-do headings in inbox file with tags and to-do keywords:
          (org-ql-query
            :select #'org-get-heading
            :from "~/org/inbox.org"
            :where '(todo))
          ;; => ("TODO Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound  :personal:" ...)

          ;; Without tags and to-do keywords:
          (org-ql-query
            :select '(org-get-heading t t)
            :from "~/org/inbox.org"
            :where '(todo))
          ;; => ("Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound" ...)

          ;; Return WAITING heading elements in agenda files:
          (org-ql-query
            :select 'element
            :from (org-agenda-files)
            :where '(todo "WAITING"))
          ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

          ;; Since `element' is the default for SELECT, it may be omitted:
          (org-ql-query
            :from (org-agenda-files)
            :where '(todo "WAITING"))
          ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

  3. Macro: ‘org-ql’

     _Arguments:_ ‘(buffers-or-files query &key sort narrow markers
     action)’

     Expands into a call to ‘org-ql-select’ with the same arguments.
     For convenience, arguments should be unquoted.

5.6 0.4
=======

_Note:_ The next release, 0.5, may include changes which will require
minor updates to written queries (e.g.  a few predicates may be
renamed).  Users who wish to avoid those changes happening unexpectedly
in their configs should avoid upgrading org-ql beyond 0.4 automatically,
as they will be pushed to the master branch when ready.

   *Added*
   • *Commands*
        • ‘helm-org-ql-views’, which shows one of ‘org-ql-views’
          selected with Helm.
        • ‘org-ql-search’ can search files in ‘org-directory’;
          customization options are available in the ‘org-ql-search’
          group.
        • ‘org-ql-view-refresh’ can be called with a prefix argument to
          adjust search parameters.
   • *Queries*
        • Negation of terms in plain queries using ‘!’.  For example,
          ‘tags:space !moon’ to exclude entries which contain ‘moon’.
        • Predicates outline-path (alias olp) and outline-path-segment
          (alias olps).
        • Predicate ‘src’, which matches Org Babel source blocks.
        • Predicates parent and ancestors.  (Thanks to Josh Moller-Mara
          (https://github.com/mm--).)
        • Alias h for heading predicate.
        • Alias r for regexp predicate.  (Thanks to Feng Shu
          (https://github.com/tumashu).)
   • Info manual.
   • Function ‘helm-org-ql-source’, which returns a Helm source that
     searches given buffers/files with ‘helm-org-ql’.  It can be used
     for custom Helm commands that search certain files.
   • Display a message when views are refreshed.  (Thanks to xeijin
     (https://github.com/xeijin).)
   • Respect Org Agenda restriction in org-ql-block.  (Thanks to Ihor
     Radchenko (https://github.com/yantar92) for reporting.)
   • Option org-ql-view-sidebar-sort-views.
   • Mouseover help-echo text for org-ql-views default view names.
   • "Dangling tasks" default view in org-ql-views.  (Users who have
     modified org-ql-views from the default will not see the new view
     unless they copy it into their config.)

   *Changed*
   • Some default org-ql-view views (users who have modified
     org-ql-views from the default will not see the new views unless
     they copy them into their config):
        • Rename some views.
        • "Stuck projects" view (now uses descendants instead of
          children, which is more useful.

   *Fixed*
   • Inherit file tags when org-tag-inheritance is enabled.  (Fixes #55
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/55).  Thanks to Mikhail
     Skorzhinskiy (https://github.com/mskorzhinskiy).)
   • Call helm-make-source directly instead of using
     helm-build-sync-source macro.  (Fixes #60
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/60).  Thanks to Matt
     Huszagh (https://github.com/matthuszagh) for reporting.)
   • Search/view buffers now always end with a newline, which prevents
     side-scrolling of the window when calling end-of-buffer.
   • Face for done to-do keywords in org-ql-view buffers.  (Thanks to
     Yiming Chen (https://github.com/dsdshcym).)
   • Make view buffers read-only.  (Fixes #72
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/72).  Thanks to xeijin
     (https://github.com/xeijin).)
   • Sorting with single sorter specified as an atom.  (Thanks to Jeff
     Filipovits (https://github.com/legalnonsense).)
   • Autoload for org-ql-block agenda block.  (Fixes #53
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/53).  Thanks to reports
     from Gus Cantieni (https://github.com/gcantieni), Karl Voit
     (https://github.com/novoid), rieje (https://github.com/rieje), and
     Jake | Junxuan (https://github.com/jakejx).)

   *Internal*
   • Added generic node data cache to speed up recursive, tree-based
     queries.

5.7 0.3.2
=========

*Fixed*
   • In org-ql-search, accept symbol as ‘:super-groups’ argument.
   • In the This week and Next week default org-ql-views views, set
     timestamps for beginning-of-week to 00:00:00 and end-of-week to
     23:59:59.
   • Plain quoted-phrases in non-sexp queries.

File: README.info,  Node: 03,  Next: 023,  Prev: 031,  Up: Changelog

5.9 0.3
=======

*Added*
   • Alternative, non-sexp query syntax for commands org-ql-search and
     helm-org-ql.  See .
   • Command helm-org-ql.
   • Command org-ql-sparse-tree, like org-sparse-tree for org-ql
     queries.  (Thanks to Akira Komamura (https://github.com/akirak).)
   • Command org-ql-view-sidebar.
   • Per-buffer, per-heading tag caching, which increases the speed of
     tags-related queries by 6-7x.
   • More tags-related predicates and aliases:
        • For inherited tags: tags-inherited, inherited-tags, tags-i,
          itags.
        • For heading-local tags: tags-local, local-tags, tags-l, ltags.
        • tags-all, tags&: Matches all given tags using boolean AND
          (rather than boolean OR, which the tags predicate uses).
   • Variable org-ql-block-header, which overrides the default header in
     org-ql-block agenda blocks.
   • Predicate (path).
   • Option org-ql-views may now be customized in a guided, structured
     way with the customization UI (e.g.
     M-x customize-option RET org-ql-views RET, or press c in the
     org-ql-view-sidebar buffer).
   • Enable more Org Agenda commands in org-ql-view buffers (e.g.
     setting deadlines and scheduling).  (Fixes #35
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/35).  Thanks to Milan
     Zamazal (https://github.com/mz-pdm) and Mikhail Skorzhinskii
     (https://github.com/mskorzhinskiy).)
   • Function org-ql-select’s buffers-files argument can be a function
     which returns a list of buffers and/or files.

   *Changed*
   • Predicate heading now accepts multiple regexps, which are matched
     with boolean AND.
   • Predicate regexp now matches its regexp arguments with boolean AND.
   • Package org-super-agenda is now a dependency.  This removes the
     need for awkward code to handle the case where it’s not installed,
     and makes grouping features always available.  Of course, the
     global minor mode org-super-agenda-mode is not activated by org-ql,
     so no behavior is changed in Org Agenda or org-ql; it only means
     that commands like org-ql-search will always provide grouping when
     called with the appropriate arguments.

   *Removed*
   • Macro org-ql-agenda.  Instead, use function org-ql-search.  See
     also command org-ql-view, etc.

   *Fixed*
   • Predicate heading now matches only against heading text, i.e.  not
     including tags at the end of the line, to-do keyword, etc.
   • Predicate todo now matches case-sensitively, avoiding
     non-todo-keyword matches (e.g.  a heading which begins Waiting on
     will no longer match for a todo keyword WAITING).
   • Interactive completion in org-ql-search.

   *Internal*
   • Refactored code from file org-ql-agenda.el into files
     org-ql-search.el and org-ql-view.el.  Function and variable names
     have been changed accordingly.

5.10 0.2.3
==========

*Fixed*
   • Priority queries could fail to match headings whose to-do keywords
     had non-alphabetic characters, like TO-READ.

5.11 0.2.2

*Fixed*
   • (deadline auto) selector matched entries whose deadlines had a
     warning period that had not yet been entered
     (org-deadline-warning-days too soon).


File: README.info,  Node: 021,  Next: 02,  Prev: 022,  Up: Changelog

5.12 0.2.1
==========

*Fixed*
   • (descendants) selector matched against parent heading instead of
     only descendants.


File: README.info,  Node: 02,  Next: 01,  Prev: 021,  Up: Changelog

5.13 0.2
========

*Added*
   • Function ‘org-ql-query’, like ‘org-ql-select’ but with arguments
     named more like a SQL query.
   • Bare strings like ‘"string"’ can be used in queries, which are
     converted to ‘(regexp "string")’ automatically.
   • Selector ‘(regexp)’ accepts multiple regexps to test.
   • Macro ‘org-ql’ and functions ‘org-ql-query’ and ‘org-ql-select’ now
     also accept a comparator function in their ‘:sort’ argument.
   • Function ‘org-ql-block’, which works as an Org Agenda
     series/composite/block command, usable in custom agenda commands
     defined in variable ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  (Inspired by
     Benson Chu’s config
     (https://github.com/pestctrl/emacs-config/blob/84c557982a860e86d6f67976a82ea776a7bd2c7a/config-org-new.org#my-own-agenda-renderer).)
   • Function ‘org-ql-agenda--agenda’ optionally takes a list of entries
     as an argument.
   • Selectors ‘ts-a’ and ‘ts-i’, aliases for ‘ts-active’ and
     ‘ts-inactive’.
   • Selector ‘ts’ now accepts a ‘:type’ argument.
   • Face org-ql-agenda-due-date.
   • Selectors ‘(children)’ and ‘(descendants)’.
   • Function ‘org-ql-search’ and macro ‘org-ql-agenda’ accept a
     ‘:title’ argument, which is displayed in the header.
   • Command ‘org-ql-search’ offers global ‘org-super-agenda-groups’ in
     completion.
   • Customization group ‘org-ql’.
   • Command ‘org-ql-view’, which displays views saved to variable
     ‘org-ql-views’, which can be saved from ‘org-ql-search’ buffers
     with command ‘org-ql-search-save’, which is bound to C-x C-s in
     view buffers.
   • Variable ‘org-ql-view-map’, active in view buffers displayed by
     ‘org-ql-search’, ‘org-ql-agenda’, and ‘org-ql-view’.
   • random sort method.
   • Save position when refreshing search buffers.

   *Changed*
   • Function ‘org-ql-query’ renamed to ‘org-ql-select’.  ‘org-ql-query’
     now refers to a new function.
   • Macro ‘org-ql’ no longer accepts a ‘:markers’ argument.  Instead,
     use argument ‘:action element-with-markers’.  See function
     ‘org-ql-select’, which ‘org-ql’ calls.
   • Selector ‘(todo)’ no longer matches "done" keywords when used
     without arguments (i.e.  the ones in variable ‘org-done-keywords’).
   • Overhauled date/time-based predicates.  See documentation for new
     argument signatures.

   *Removed*
   • Selector ‘(date)’, replaced by ‘(ts)’.

   *Fixed*
   • Handle date ranges in date-based selectors.  (Thanks to Cody
     Goodman (https://github.com/codygman), Samuel W. Flint
     (https://github.com/swflint), and Vikas Rawal
     (https://github.com/vikasrawal).)
   • Don’t overwrite bindings in org-agenda-mode-map.
   • Don’t search buffers without headings, and show a message if the
     user attempts it.
   • Don’t search hidden/special buffers.
   • Properly accept arbitrary sort functions in org-ql-select, etc.
     (Fixes #37 (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/37).  Thanks
     to Milan Zamazal (https://github.com/mz-pdm).)
   • Planning-line-related predicates searched too far into entries.
   • Add autoloads.  (Fixes #36
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/pull/36/files#).  Thanks to
     Akira Komamura (https://github.com/akirak).)

   *Compatibility*
   • Fixes for compatibility with Org 9.2.  (Thanks to Ataias Pereira
     Reis (https://github.com/ataias) and Daniel Kraus
     (https://github.com/dakra).)

   *Internal*
   • Optimizations for some query selectors, e.g.  regexp and todo.
     These can provide a significant improvement for some queries.  See
     benchmarks in notes.org (notes.org).
   • Library ts (https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el) is now used for
     parsing and comparing timestamps.

6.1 Comparison with Org Agenda searches
=======================================

Of course, queries like these can already be written with Org Agenda
searches, but the syntax can be complex.  For example, this query would
be difficult to write in a standard Org Agenda search, because it
matches against a to-do keyword _and_ a plain-text search.  As described
in the advanced searching tutorial
(https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html#combining-metadata-and-full-text-queries),
it would require using ‘org-search-view’ with a query with specific
regular expression syntax, like this:

+lisp +{^\*+\s-+TO-READ\s-}

   But with org-ql-search, you would write a query like
lisp todo:TO-READ, or in Lisp syntax, ‘(and "lisp" (todo "TO-READ"))’.

6.2 org-sidebar
===============

This package is used by org-sidebar
