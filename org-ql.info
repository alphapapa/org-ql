org-ql
******

This package provides a query language for Org files.  It offers two
syntax styles: Lisp-like sexps and search engine-like keywords.

   It includes three libraries: The ‘org-ql’ library is flexible and may
be used as a backend for other tools.  The libraries ‘org-ql-search’ and
‘helm-org-ql’ (a separate package) provide interactive search commands
and saved views.

File: README.info,  Node: org-ql-find,  Next: org-ql-open-link,  Up: Commands

4.1.1 org-ql-find
-----------------

_Note: These commands use ._

   These commands jump to a heading selected using Emacs’s built-in
completion facilities with an Org QL query:

   • ‘org-ql-find’ searches in the current buffer.
   • ‘org-ql-find-path’ searches outline paths in the current buffer.
   • ‘org-ql-find-in-agenda’ searches in ‘(org-agenda-files)’.
   • ‘org-ql-find-in-org-directory’ searches in ‘org-directory’.

   Note that these commands are compatible with Embark
(https://github.com/oantolin/embark): the ‘embark-act’ command can be
called on a completion candidate (i.e.  a search result) to act on it
immediately, without having to visit the entry in its source Org buffer,
and ‘embark-export’ may be called to show the results in an
‘org-ql-view’ buffer.


File: README.info,  Node: org-ql-open-link,  Next: org-ql-refile,  Prev: org-ql-find,  Up: Commands

4.1.2 org-ql-open-link
----------------------

This command finds links in entries matching the input query and offers
them for selection; the selected link is then opened with
‘org-open-at-point’.

   The input is matched using the default predicate, which means it
searches both entry content and outline paths.  This is helpful when a
collection of links are kept in Org files: rather than having to first
visit the entry containing the desired link, then locate it within the
entry, and then open it, the user can simply select the link and open it
directly.  For example, if an entry with the heading ‘Emacs’ contained a
link named ‘mailing list’, one could search for ‘Emacs list’ and open
the link to the mailing list directly.

4.1.3 org-ql-refile
-------------------

This command refiles the current Org entry to one selected by searching
with Org QL completion.  It searches files listed in
‘org-refile-targets’ as well as the current buffer.


File: README.info,  Node: org-ql-search,  Next: helm-org-ql,  Prev: org-ql-refile,  Up: Commands

4.1.4 org-ql-search
-------------------

_Note: This command supports both sexp queries and ._

   Read ‘QUERY’ and search with ‘org-ql’.  Interactively, prompt for
these variables:

   ‘BUFFERS-FILES’: ‘A’ list of buffers and/or files to search.
Interactively, may also be:

   • ‘buffer’: search the current buffer
   • ‘all’: search all Org buffers
   • ‘agenda’: search buffers returned by the function
     ‘org-agenda-files’
   • A space-separated list of file or buffer names

   ‘GROUPS’: An ‘org-super-agenda’ group set.  See variable
‘org-super-agenda-groups’.

   ‘NARROW’: When non-nil, don’t widen buffers before searching.
Interactively, with prefix, leave narrowed.

   ‘SORT’: One or a list of ‘org-ql’ sorting functions, like ‘date’ or
‘priority’.

   *Bindings:* Keys bound in results buffer.
   • ‘r’: Refresh results.  With prefix, prompt to adjust search
     parameters.
   • ‘v’: Show ‘transient’ view dispatcher (like Magit’s popups).
   • ‘C-x C-s’: Save query to variable ‘org-ql-views’ (accessible with
     command ‘org-ql-view’).

   *Note:* The view buffer is currently put in ‘org-agenda-mode’, which
means that _some_ Org Agenda commands work, such as jumping to entries
and changing item priorities (without necessarily updating the view).
This feature is experimental and not guaranteed to work correctly with
all commands.  (It works to the extent it does because the appropriate
text properties are placed on each item, imitating an Agenda buffer.)

   *Note:* Also, this buffer is compatible with Embark
(https://github.com/oantolin/embark): the ‘embark-act’ command can be
called on an entry to act on it immediately, without having to visit the
entry in its source Org buffer.

-----------------

_Note: This command uses .  It is available separately in the package
‘helm-org-ql’._

   This command displays matches with Helm.

   • Press ‘C-x C-s’ in the Helm session to save the results to an
     ‘org-ql-search’ buffer.

4.1.6 org-ql-view
-----------------

Choose and display a view stored in ‘org-ql-views’.

   *Bindings:* Keys bound in view buffer.
   • ‘g’, ‘r’: Refresh results.  With prefix, prompt to adjust search
     parameters.
   • ‘v’: Show ‘transient’ view dispatcher (like Magit’s popups).
   • ‘C-x C-s’: Save query to variable ‘org-ql-views’ (accessible with
     command ‘org-ql-view’).

4.1.7 org-ql-view-sidebar
-------------------------

Show a sidebar window listing views stored in ‘org-ql-views’ for easy
access.  In the sidebar, press ‘RET’ or ‘mouse-1’ to show the view at
point, and press ‘c’ to customize the view at point.

4.1.8 org-ql-view-recent-items
------------------------------

Show items in ‘FILES’ from last ‘DAYS’ days with timestamps of ‘TYPE’.
‘TYPE’ may be ‘ts’, ‘ts-active’, ‘ts-inactive’, ‘clocked’, ‘closed’,
‘deadline’, ‘planning’, or ‘scheduled’.  ‘FILES’ defaults to those
returned by the function ‘org-agenda-files’.


File: README.info,  Node: org-ql-sparse-tree,  Prev: org-ql-view-recent-items,  Up: Commands

4.1.9 org-ql-sparse-tree
------------------------

Arguments: ‘(query &key keep-previous (buffer (current-buffer)))’

   Show a sparse tree for ‘QUERY’ in ‘BUFFER’ and return number of
results.  The tree will show the lines where the query matches, and any
other context defined in ‘org-show-context-detail’, which see.

   ‘QUERY’ is an ‘org-ql’ query sexp (quoted, since this is a function).
‘BUFFER’ defaults to the current buffer.  When ‘KEEP-PREVIOUS’ is
non-nil (interactively, with prefix), the outline is not reset to the
overview state before finding matches, which allows stacking calls to
this command.  Runs ‘org-occur-hook’ after making the sparse tree.


File: README.info,  Node: Queries,  Next: Functions / Macros,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Usage

4.2 Queries
===========

   • • • • 
   An ‘org-ql’ query is a Lisp expression which may contain arbitrary
expressions, as well as calling certain built-in predicates.  It is
byte-compiled into a predicate function which is tested with point on
each heading in an Org buffer; when it returns non-nil, the heading
matches the query.  When possible, certain built-in predicates are
optimized away to whole-buffer regular expression searches, which are
much faster to search for than testing the predicate on each heading.

   *Notes:*
   • Bare strings like ‘"string"’ are automatically converted to
     ‘(regexp "string")’ predicates.
   • Standard numeric comparator function symbols (‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>’, ‘>=’,
     ‘=’ ) need not be quoted when passed as an argument to predicates
     which accept them.  The resemblance to infix notation is
     coincidental.

4.2.1 Non-sexp query syntax
---------------------------

The command ‘org-ql-search’ also accepts, and the command ‘helm-org-ql’
only accepts, an alternative, non-sexp query syntax.  The syntax is
simple, and a few examples of queries in both syntaxes should suffice.
By default, when multiple predicates are used, they are combined with
boolean ‘and’.

Sexp syntax                                         Non-sexp syntax
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘(todo)’                                            ‘todo:’
‘(todo "SOMEDAY")’                                  ‘todo:SOMEDAY’
‘(todo "SOMEDAY" "WAITING")’                        ‘todo:SOMEDAY,WAITING’
‘(ts :on today)’                                    ‘ts:on=today’
‘(ts-active :from "2017-01-01" :to "2018-01-01")’   ‘ts-active:from=2017-01-01,to=2018-01-01’
‘(clocked :on -1)’                                  ‘clocked:on=-1’
‘(heading "quoted phrase" "word")’                  ‘heading:"quoted phrase",word’
‘(and (tags "book" "books") (priority "A"))’        ‘tags:book,books priority:A’
‘(src :lang "elisp" :regexps ("defun"))’            ‘src:defun,lang=elisp’ or ‘src:lang=elisp,defun’
‘(and (tags "space") (not (regexp "moon")))’        ‘tags:space !moon’
‘(priority >= B)’                                   ‘priority:A,B’

   Note that the ‘effort’, ‘level’, and ‘priority’ predicates do not
support comparators in the non-sexp syntax, so multiple arguments should
be passed instead, as seen in the last example.


File: README.info,  Node: General predicates,  Next: Ancestor/descendant predicates,  Prev: Non-sexp query syntax,  Up: Queries

4.2.2 General predicates
------------------------

Arguments are listed next to predicate names, where applicable.

‘blocked’
     Return non-nil if current heading is blocked.  Calls
     ‘org-entry-blocked-p’, which see.
‘category (&optional categories)’
     Return non-nil if current heading is in one or more of ‘CATEGORIES’
     (a list of strings).
‘done’
     Return non-nil if entry’s ‘TODO’ keyword is in ‘org-done-keywords’.
‘effort (&optional effort-or-comparator effort)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s effort property matches
     arguments.  The following forms are accepted: ‘(effort DURATION)’:
     Matches if effort is ‘DURATION’.  ‘(effort DURATION DURATION)’:
     Matches if effort is between DURATIONs, inclusive.  ‘(effort
     COMPARATOR DURATION)’: Matches if effort compares to ‘DURATION’
     with ‘COMPARATOR’.  ‘COMPARATOR’ may be ‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>’, or ‘>=’.
     ‘DURATION’ should be an Org effort string, like ‘5’ or ‘0:05’.
‘habit’
     Return non-nil if entry is a habit.
‘heading (&rest strings)’
     Return non-nil if current entry’s heading matches all ‘STRINGS’.
     Matching is done case-insensitively.
        • Aliases: ‘h’.
‘heading-regexp (&rest regexps)’
     Return non-nil if current entry’s heading matches all ‘REGEXPS’
     (regexp strings).  Matching is done case-insensitively.
        • Aliases: ‘h*’.
‘level (level-or-comparator &optional level)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s outline level matches
     arguments.  The following forms are accepted: ‘(level NUMBER)’:
     Matches if heading level is ‘NUMBER’.  ‘(level NUMBER NUMBER)’:
     Matches if heading level is equal to or between NUMBERs.  ‘(level
     COMPARATOR NUMBER)’: Matches if heading level compares to ‘NUMBER’
     with ‘COMPARATOR’.  ‘COMPARATOR’ may be ‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>’, or ‘>=’.
‘link (&optional description-or-target &key description target regexp-p)’
     Return non-nil if current heading contains a link matching
     arguments.  ‘DESCRIPTION-OR-TARGET’ is matched against the link’s
     description and target.  Alternatively, one or both of
     ‘DESCRIPTION’ and ‘TARGET’ may be matched separately.  Without
     arguments, return non-nil if any link is found.
‘outline-path (&rest strings)’
     Return non-nil if current node’s outline path matches all of
     ‘STRINGS’.  Each string may appear as a substring in any part of
     the node’s outline path.  For example, the path
     ‘Food/Fruits/Grapes’ would match ‘(olp "Fruit" "Grape")’.
        • Aliases: ‘olp’.
‘outline-path-segment (&rest strings)’
     Return non-nil if current node’s outline path matches ‘STRINGS’.
     Matches ‘STRINGS’ as a contiguous segment of the outline path.
     Each string is compared as a substring.  For example the path
     ‘Food/Fruits/Grapes’ would match ‘(olps "Fruit" "Grape")’ but not
     ‘(olps "Food" "Grape")’.
        • Aliases: ‘olps’.
‘path (&rest regexps)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s buffer’s filename path matches
     any of ‘REGEXPS’ (regexp strings).  Without arguments, return
     non-nil if buffer is file-backed.
‘priority (&rest args)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has a certain priority.  ‘ARGS’
     may be either a list of one or more priority letters as strings, or
     a comparator function symbol followed by a priority letter string.
     For example: ‘(priority "A") (priority "A" "B") (priority '>= "B")’
     Note that items without a priority cookie never match this
     predicate (while Org itself considers items without a cookie to
     have the default priority, which, by default, is equal to priority
     ‘B’).
‘property (property &optional value &key inherit)’
     Return non-nil if current entry has ‘PROPERTY’ (a string), and
     optionally ‘VALUE’ (a string).  If ‘INHERIT’ is nil, only match
     entries with ‘PROPERTY’ set on the entry; if t, also match entries
     with inheritance.  If ‘INHERIT’ is not specified, use the value of
     ‘org-use-property-inheritance’, which see.
‘regexp (&rest regexps)’
     Return non-nil if current entry matches all of ‘REGEXPS’ (regexp
     strings).  Matches against entire entry, from beginning of its
     heading to the next heading.
        • Aliases: ‘r’.
‘rifle (&rest strings)’
     Return non-nil if each string is found in either the entry or its
     outline path.  Works like ‘org-rifle’.  This is probably the most
     useful, intuitive, general-purpose predicate.
        • Aliases: ‘smart’.
        • *Note:* By default, this is the default predicate used for
          plain-string query tokens (i.e.  given without a specified
          predicate).  This can be customized with the option
          ‘org-ql-default-predicate’.
‘src (&key lang regexps)’
     Return non-nil if current entry contains an Org Babel source block.
     If ‘LANG’ is non-nil, match blocks of that language.  If ‘REGEXPS’
     is non-nil, require that block’s contents match all regexps.
     Matching is done case-insensitively.
‘tags (&optional tags)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has one or more of ‘TAGS’ (a list
     of strings).  Tests both inherited and local tags.
‘tags-inherited (&optional tags)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s inherited tags include one or
     more of ‘TAGS’ (a list of strings).  If ‘TAGS’ is nil, return
     non-nil if heading has any inherited tags.
        • Aliases: ‘inherited-tags’, ‘tags-i’, ‘itags’.
‘tags-local (&optional tags)’
     Return non-nil if current heading’s local tags include one or more
     of ‘TAGS’ (a list of strings).  If ‘TAGS’ is nil, return non-nil if
     heading has any local tags.
        • Aliases: ‘local-tags’, ‘tags-l’, ‘ltags’.
‘tags-all (tags)’
     Return non-nil if current heading includes all of ‘TAGS’.  Tests
     both inherited and local tags.
        • Aliases: ‘tags&’.
‘tags-regexp (&rest regexps)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has tags matching one or more of
     ‘REGEXPS’.  Tests both inherited and local tags.
        • Aliases: ‘tags*’.
‘todo (&optional keywords)’
     Return non-nil if current heading is a ‘TODO’ item.  With
     ‘KEYWORDS’, return non-nil if its keyword is one of ‘KEYWORDS’ (a
     list of strings).  When called without arguments, only matches
     non-done tasks (i.e.  does not match keywords in
     ‘org-done-keywords’).


File: README.info,  Node: Ancestor/descendant predicates,  Next: Date/time predicates,  Prev: General predicates,  Up: Queries

4.2.3 Ancestor/descendant predicates
------------------------------------

‘ancestors (&optional query)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has ancestor headings.  If
     ‘QUERY’, return non-nil if an ancestor heading matches it.  This
     selector may be nested.
‘children (&optional query)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has direct child headings.  If
     ‘QUERY’, return non-nil if a child heading matches it.  This
     selector may be nested, e.g.  to match grandchild headings.
‘descendants (&optional query)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has descendant headings.  If
     ‘QUERY’, return non-nil if a descendant heading matches it.  This
     selector may be nested (if you can grok the nesting!).
‘parent (&optional query)’
     Return non-nil if current heading has a direct parent heading.  If
     ‘QUERY’, return non-nil if the parent heading matches it.  This
     selector may be nested, e.g.  to match grandparent headings.


File: README.info,  Node: Date/time predicates,  Prev: Ancestor/descendant predicates,  Up: Queries

4.2.4 Date/time predicates
--------------------------

These predicates take optional keyword arguments:

   • ‘:from’: Match entries whose timestamp is on or after timestamp
     ‘:from’.
   • ‘:to’: Match entries whose timestamp is on or before timestamp
     ‘:to’.
   • ‘:on’: Match entries whose timestamp is on date ‘:on’.
   • ‘:with-time’: If unspecified, match timestamps with or without
     times (i.e.  HH:MM). If nil, match timestamps without times.  If t,
     match timestamps with times.

   Timestamp/date arguments should be either a number of days (positive
to look forward, or negative to look backward), a string parseable by
‘parse-time-string’ (the string may omit the time value), the symbol
‘today’, or a ‘ts’ struct.

   • *Predicates*
     ‘ts’
          Return non-nil if current entry has a timestamp in given
          period.  Without arguments, return non-nil if entry has a
          timestamp.
     ‘ts-active’, ‘ts-a’
          Like ‘ts’, but only matches active timestamps.
     ‘ts-inactive’, ‘ts-i’
          Like ‘ts’, but only matches inactive timestamps.

   The following predicates, in addition to the keyword arguments, can
also take a single argument, a number, which looks backward or forward a
number of days.  The number can be negative to invert the direction.

   These two predicates interpret a single number argument as if it were
passed to the ‘:from’ keyword argument, which eases the common case of
searching for items clocked or closed in the past few days:

   • *Backward-looking*
     ‘clocked’
          Return non-nil if current entry was clocked in given period.
          Without arguments, return non-nil if entry was ever clocked.
          Note: Clock entries are expected to be clocked out.  Currently
          clocked entries (i.e.  with unclosed timestamp ranges) are
          ignored.
     ‘closed’
          Return non-nil if current entry was closed in given period.
          Without arguments, return non-nil if entry is closed.

   These predicates interpret a single number argument as if it were
passed to the ‘:to’ keyword argument, which eases the common case of
searching for items planned in the next few days:

   • *Forward-looking*
     ‘deadline’
          Return non-nil if current entry has deadline in given period.
          If argument is ‘auto’, return non-nil if entry has deadline
          within ‘org-deadline-warning-days’.  Without arguments, return
          non-nil if entry has any deadline.
     ‘planning’
          Return non-nil if current entry has planning timestamp (i.e.
          its deadline, scheduled, or closed timestamp) in given period.
          Without arguments, return non-nil if entry has any planning
          timestamp.
     ‘scheduled’
          Return non-nil if current entry is scheduled in given period.
          Without arguments, return non-nil if entry is scheduled.

4.3.1 Agenda-like views
-----------------------

  1. Function: ‘org-ql-block’

     For use as a custom agenda block type in
     ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  For example, you could define a
     custom series command like this, which would list all priority A
     items tagged ‘Emacs’ with to-do keyword ‘SOMEDAY’, followed by the
     standard agenda view, in a single buffer:

          (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
                '(("ces" "Custom: Agenda and Emacs SOMEDAY [#A] items"
                   ((org-ql-block '(and (todo "SOMEDAY")
                                        (tags "Emacs")
                                        (priority "A"))
                                  ((org-ql-block-header "SOMEDAY :Emacs: High-priority")))
                    (agenda)))))

     Which would be equivalent to a ‘tags-todo’ search like this:

          (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
                '(("ces" "Custom: Agenda and Emacs SOMEDAY [#A] items"
                   ((tags-todo "PRIORITY=\"A\"+Emacs/!SOMEDAY")
                    (agenda)))))

     However, the ‘org-ql-block’ version runs in about 1/5th the time.

     The variable ‘org-ql-block-header’ may be bound to a string to use
     as the block header, otherwise the header is formed automatically.

4.3.2 Listing / acting-on results
---------------------------------

  1. Caching

     Org QL uses a per-buffer cache to speed up subsequent searches.
     It’s keyed on query expressions and match actions, which means
     that, for the same query and same match action in the same buffer,
     if the buffer has not been modified since the last time the query
     was run, the cached match-action result will be returned, and the
     query will not be evaluated in that buffer again.

     Therefore, since neither query expressions nor match actions are
     guaranteed to be evaluated when the following functions are called,
     they should be free of side effects.  Or, if a side effect is
     required, the cache should be invalidated (e.g.  by incrementing
     the buffer’s modified tick, or by using a query expression or match
     action that has yet to be cached).  _Note: Future improvements will
     allow the cache to be more easily disabled or cleared._

  2. Function: ‘org-ql-select’

     _Arguments:_ ‘(buffers-or-files query &key action narrow sort)’

     Return items matching ‘QUERY’ in ‘BUFFERS-OR-FILES’.

     ‘BUFFERS-OR-FILES’ is a one or a list of files and/or buffers.

     ‘QUERY’ is an ‘org-ql’ query sexp (quoted, since this is a
     function).

     ‘ACTION’ is a function which is called on each matching entry with
     point at the beginning of its heading.  It may be:

        • ‘element’ or nil: Equivalent to ‘org-element-headline-parser’.

        • ‘element-with-markers’: Equivalent to calling
          ‘org-element-headline-parser’, with markers added using
          ‘org-ql--add-markers’.  Suitable for formatting with
          ‘org-ql-agenda--format-element’, allowing insertion into an
          Org Agenda-like buffer.

        • A sexp, which will be byte-compiled into a lambda function.

        • A function symbol.

     If ‘NARROW’ is non-nil, buffers are not widened (the default is to
     widen and search the entire buffer).

     ‘SORT’ is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or
     a list of defined ‘org-ql’ sorting methods (‘date’, ‘deadline’,
     ‘scheduled’, ‘closed’, ‘todo’, ‘priority’, or ‘random’); or a
     user-defined comparator function that accepts two items as
     arguments and returns nil or non-nil.

     Examples:

          ;; Return list of to-do headings in inbox file with tags and to-do keywords:
          (org-ql-select "~/org/inbox.org"
            '(todo)
            :action #'org-get-heading)
          ;; => ("TODO Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound  :personal:" ...)

          ;; Without tags and to-do keywords:
          (org-ql-select "~/org/inbox.org"
            '(todo)
            :action '(org-get-heading t t))
          ;; => ("Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound" ...)

          ;; Return WAITING heading elements in agenda files:
          (org-ql-select (org-agenda-files)
            '(todo "WAITING")
            :action 'element)
          ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

          ;; Since `element' is the default for ACTION, it may be omitted:
          (org-ql-select (org-agenda-files)
            '(todo "WAITING"))
          ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

  3. Function: ‘org-ql-query’

     _Arguments:_ ‘(&key (select 'element-with-markers) from where
     order-by narrow)’

     Like ‘org-ql-select’, but arguments are named more like a ‘SQL’
     query.

        • ‘SELECT’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument ‘ACTION’.
        • ‘FROM’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument
          ‘BUFFERS-OR-FILES’.
        • ‘WHERE’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument ‘QUERY’.
        • ‘ORDER-BY’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument ‘SORT’,
          which see.
        • ‘NARROW’ corresponds to the ‘org-ql-select’ argument ‘NARROW’.

     Examples:

          ;; Return list of to-do headings in inbox file with tags and to-do keywords:
          (org-ql-query
            :select #'org-get-heading
            :from "~/org/inbox.org"
            :where '(todo))
          ;; => ("TODO Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound  :personal:" ...)

          ;; Without tags and to-do keywords:
          (org-ql-query
            :select '(org-get-heading t t)
            :from "~/org/inbox.org"
            :where '(todo))
          ;; => ("Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound" ...)

          ;; Return WAITING heading elements in agenda files:
          (org-ql-query
            :select 'element
            :from (org-agenda-files)
            :where '(todo "WAITING"))
          ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

          ;; Since `element' is the default for SELECT, it may be omitted:
          (org-ql-query
            :from (org-agenda-files)
            :where '(todo "WAITING"))
          ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

  4. Macro: ‘org-ql’ (deprecated)

     _Arguments:_ ‘(buffers-or-files query &key sort narrow markers
     action)’

     Expands into a call to ‘org-ql-select’ with the same arguments.
     For convenience, arguments should be unquoted.

     _Note: This macro is deprecated and will be removed in v0.7._


File: README.info,  Node: Custom predicates,  Prev: Listing / acting-on results,  Up: Functions / Macros

4.3.3 Custom predicates
-----------------------

   • See: Custom predicate tutorial (examples/defpred.org)

  1. Macro: ‘org-ql-defpred’

     _Arguments:_ ‘(name args docstring &key body preambles
     normalizers)’

     Define an ‘org-ql’ selector predicate named
     ‘org-ql--predicate-NAME’.  ‘NAME’ may be a symbol or a list of
     symbols: if a list, the first is used as ‘NAME’ and the rest are
     aliases.  ‘A’ function is only created for ‘NAME’, not for aliases,
     so a normalizer should be used to replace aliases with ‘NAME’ in
     queries (keep reading).

     ‘ARGS’ is a ‘cl-defun’-style argument list.  ‘DOCSTRING’ is the
     function’s docstring.

     ‘BODY’ is the body of the predicate.  It will be evaluated with
     point on the beginning of an Org heading and should return non-nil
     if the heading’s entry is a match.

     ‘PREAMBLES’ and ‘NORMALIZERS’ are lists of ‘pcase’ forms matched
     against Org ‘QL’ query sexps.  They are spliced into ‘pcase’ forms
     in the definitions of the functions ‘org-ql--query-preamble’ and
     ‘org-ql--normalize-query’, which see.  Those functions are
     redefined when this macro is expanded, unless variable
     ‘org-ql-defpred-defer’ is non-nil, in which case those functions
     should be redefined manually after defining predicates by calling
     ‘org-ql--define-query-preamble-fn’ and
     ‘org-ql--define-normalize-query-fn’.

     ‘NORMALIZERS’ are used to normalize query expressions to standard
     forms.  For example, when the predicate has aliases, the aliases
     should be replaced with predicate names using a normalizer.  Also,
     predicate arguments may be put into a more optimal form so that the
     predicate has less work to do at query time.  NOTE: Normalizers are
     applied to a query repeatedly until the query is fully normalized,
     so normalizers should be carefully written to avoid infinite loops.

     ‘PREAMBLES’ refer to regular expressions which may be used to
     search through a buffer directly to a potential match rather than
     testing the predicate body on each heading.  (Naming things is
     hard.)  In each ‘pcase’ form in ‘PREAMBLES’, the ‘pcase’ expression
     (not the pattern) should be a plist with the following keys, each
     value of which should be an expression which may refer to variables
     bound in the pattern:

     ‘:regexp’ Regular expression which searches directly to a potential
     match.

     ‘:case-fold’ Bound to ‘case-fold-search’ around the regexp search.

     ‘:query’ Expression which should replace the query expression, or
     ‘query’ if it should not be changed (e.g.  if the regexp is
     insufficient to determine whether a heading matches, in which case
     the predicate’s body needs to be tested on the heading).  If the
     regexp guarantees a match, this may be simply ‘t’, leaving the
     query expression with no work to do, which improves performance.

     For convenience, within the ‘pcase’ patterns, the symbol
     ‘predicate-names’ is a special form which is replaced with a
     pattern matching any of the predicate’s name and aliases.  For
     example, if ‘NAME’ were:

     ‘(heading h)’

     Then if ‘NORMALIZERS’ were:

     ‘((`(,predicate-names . ,args) `(heading ,@args)))’

     It would be expanded to:

     ‘((`(,(or 'heading 'h) . ,args) `(heading ,@args)))’

4.4 Dynamic block
=================

Org QL provides a dynamic block that lists entries in the current
document matching a query.  In the header, these parameters are
supported:

   • ‘:query’: An Org QL query expression in either sexp or non-sexp
     form.
   • ‘:columns’ A list of columns, including ‘heading’, ‘todo’,
     ‘property’, ‘priority’, ‘deadline’, ‘scheduled’, ‘closed’.
        • Each column may also be specified as a list with the second
          element being a header string.  For example, to abbreviate the
          priority column: ‘(priority "P")’.
        • For certain columns, like ‘property’, arguments may be passed
          by specifying the column type itself as a list.  For example,
          to display a column showing the values of a ‘property’ named
          ‘milestone’, with the header being abbreviated to ‘M’:
          ‘((property "milestone") "M")’.
   • ‘:sort’ One or a list of Org QL sorting methods (see
     ‘org-ql-select’).
   • ‘:take’ Optionally take a number of results from the front (a
     positive number) or the end (a negative number) of the results.
   • ‘:ts-format’ Optional format string used to format timestamp-based
     columns.

   The heading column is formatted as a link to the heading (not shown
in the following example).

   For example, this dynamic block shows the first seven headings that
are to-do items with priority A or B, sorted by deadline then priority,
with certain columns (including the value of the ‘agenda-group’ property
with a custom header) and timestamp format:

     #+BEGIN: org-ql :query "todo: priority:A,B" :columns (todo (priority "P") ((property "agenda-group") "Group") deadline heading) :sort (deadline priority) :take 7 :ts-format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
     | Todo | P | Group | Deadline         | Heading                               |
     |------+---+-------+------------------+---------------------------------------|
     | TODO | A |       | 2017-07-07 00:00 | Take over the world                   |
     | TODO | B |       | 2017-07-10 00:00 | Renew membership in supervillain club |
     | TODO | A | plans | 2017-07-15 00:00 | Take over the universe                |
     | TODO | B |       | 2017-07-21 00:00 | Internet                              |
     | TODO | A | bills | 2017-08-01 00:00 | Spaceship lease                       |
     | TODO | A |       |                  | Skype with president of Antarctica    |
     | TODO | B |       |                  | Take over Mars                        |

4.5 Links
=========

Org QL View searches may be accessed by opening ‘org-ql-search:’ links
in an Org file.

   In an Org QL View buffer, the command ‘org-store-link’ (i.e.  ‘C-c
l’) stores a link to the current search, and it may be inserted into an
Org buffer with the command ‘org-insert-link’ (‘C-c C-l’).  The stored
link records all of the view settings, like title, sorting, and
grouping.

   Simple links may also be written manually in either sexp or non-sexp
form, like:

     [[org-ql-search:todo:NEXT priority:A]]
     [[org-ql-search:(and (todo "NEXT") (priority "A"))]]

   • Org QL View buffers can be bookmarked with Emacs bookmark commands,
     e.g.  ‘C-x r m’.  This also integrates with org-sidebar
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sidebar) and Burly
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el).

*Fixes*
   • Timestamps with internal time ranges (e.g.  ‘<2024-06-26
     10:00-11:00>’) are matched for simple queries.  (This support is
     not yet comprehensive, e.g.  a query that depends on the specific
     inner time range may not behave as expected.  Previously such
     timestamps were not matched at all.  See #237
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/pull/237) and #371
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/371).  Thanks to Ihor
     Radchenko (https://github.com/yantar92).)
   • Timestamps with day-of-the-week abbreviations are matched more
     flexibly (allowing, e.g.  a period in French locales).  (See #429

5.8 0.8.1
=========

*Fixes*

   • Command ‘org-ql-find’ widens the buffer before going to the
     selected entry.
   • In ‘org-ql-view’ buffers, links in headings remain clickable links.
     (Fixes #282 (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/282).

5.9 0.8
=======

*Additions*

   • Function ‘org-ql-completing-read’, used by command ‘org-ql-find’,
     now specifies the completion category as ‘org-heading’, providing
     compatibility with Embark (https://github.com/oantolin/embark).
     (This is a powerful feature, as it means any ‘org-ql-find’ result
     can be acted on from inside the search results with Embark, which
     provides common actions from Org Agenda and Org speed keys
     bindings.)  (#299 (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/299).
     Thanks to Omar Antolín Camarena (https://github.com/oantolin),
     Daniel Mendler (https://github.com/minad), and Akira Komamura
     (https://github.com/akirak).)
        • Command ‘org-ql-completing-read-export’, bound to ‘C-c C-e’ or
          ‘embark-export’ while in an ‘org-ql-completing-read’ session,
          exits and shows an ‘org-ql-view’ buffer for the current
          search.
   • Command ‘org-ql-find’ may be called in an ‘org-agenda’ or
     ‘org-ql-view’ buffer to search the buffers which contributed to the
     agenda/view buffer.
   • Command ‘org-ql-find-path’, which searches outline paths in the
     current buffer.
   • Command ‘org-ql-open-link’, which finds links in entries matching
     the given query, and opens the selected one with
     ‘org-open-at-point’.  (This is helpful when a collection of links
     are kept in Org files: rather than having to first visit the entry
     containing the desired link, then locate it within the entry, and
     then open it, the user can simply select the link and open it
     directly.)
   • Items in ‘org-ql-view’ buffers now include the ‘org-category’ text
     property, like Org Agenda buffers, which allows grouping with
     ‘org-super-agenda’’s category-related selectors.  (#363
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/363).  Thanks to
     Gabriele Mongiano (https://github.com/kofm) for reporting.)

   *Fixes*

   • Predicate ‘property’ correctly uses the value of
     ‘org-use-property-inheritance’ when not specified.  (#346
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/pull/346), #356
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/356).  Thanks to Bram
     Schoenmakers (https://github.com/bram85).)

   *Compatibility*

   • Emacs 27.1 or later is now required.
   • Org v9.7’s ‘org-element’ API changes required some adjustments.
     (#364 (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/364).  Thanks to
     several users for reporting, and to Ihor Radchenko
     (https://github.com/yantar92) for his feedback.)

*Fixes*
   • Disable ‘case-fold-search’ when collecting headings in outline
     paths.  (Headings that started with a word that is also a to-do

     incorrectly.)
   • Saving of ‘org-ql-view’ views.  (#378

5.12 0.7.2
==========

*Fixes*
   • Timestamp predicates are more tolerant of partial input (e.g.
     preventing errors while the user is typing a query into
     ‘org-ql-find’).
   • Query parser ignores leading whitespace (e.g.  preventing errors
     while the user is typing a query into ‘org-ql-find’).
   • Use of ‘org-ql-find’ with ‘:query-prefix’ argument prevented
     selection of results.  (#351
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/351).  Thanks to Daniel
     Fleischer (https://github.com/danielfleischer) for reporting.)
   • Handle narrowed buffers correctly in ‘org-ql-find’.
   • Warn about empty headings in ‘org-ql-completing-read’ (the Org
     format allows a heading line to have no text, but it’s useless for
     this purpose, and usually indicates unnoticed corruption).


File: README.info,  Node: 071,  Next: 07,  Prev: 072,  Up: Changelog

5.13 0.7.1
==========

*Fixes*
   • Function ‘org-ql-completing-read’ is more compatible with default
     Emacs completion.  (See #338
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/338).  Thanks to
     arozbiz (https://github.com/arozbiz) for reporting.)
   • Function ‘org-ql-completing-read’ would sometimes stop updating
     with changes in input.  (See #350
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/350).  Thanks to Ankit
     Raj Pandey (https://github.com/anpandey) for reporting and fixing,
     and to Daniel Mendler (https://github.com/minad) for advising.)
   • In ‘org-ql-completing-read’, format links for display, and use
     ‘org-entry-get’ internally rather than ‘org-get-heading’.


File: README.info,  Node: 07,  Next: 063,  Prev: 071,  Up: Changelog

5.14 0.7
========

*Added*
   • Command ‘org-ql-find’, which jumps to entries selected using
     Emacs’s built-in completion facilities and Org QL queries (like
     ‘helm-org-ql’, but doesn’t require Helm.).
   • Command ‘org-ql-refile’, which refiles the entry at point to one
     selected using Org QL completion.
   • Predicate ‘rifle’, which matches an entry if each of the given
     arguments is found in either the entry’s contents or its outline
     path.  This provides very intuitive results, mimicing the behavior
     of ‘org-rifle’ (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-rifle).  In fact,
     the results are so useful that it’s now the default predicate for
     plain-string query tokens.  (It is also aliased to ‘smart’, since
     it’s so "smart," and not all users have used ‘org-rifle’.)
   • Option ‘org-ql-default-predicate’, applied to plain-string query
     tokens (before, the ‘regexp’ predicate was always used, but now it
     may be customized).
   • Alias ‘c’ for predicate ‘category’.
   • Predicate ‘property’ now accepts the argument ‘:inherit’ to match
     entries with property inheritance, and when unspecified, the option
     ‘org-use-property-inheritance’ controls whether inheritance is
     used.
   • Predicate ‘blocked’.  (Thanks to Akira Komamura
     (https://github.com/akirak).)

   *Changed*
   • Give more useful error message for invalid queries.
   • Predicate ‘src’ now matches case-insensitively.
   • Command ‘org-ql-sparse-tree’ accepts both string and sexp queries.
     (Thanks to Akira Komamura (https://github.com/akirak).)

   *Fixed*
   • Predicate ‘link’ matches links whose descriptions contain escaped
     brackets (changed in Org 9.3).  (Thanks to Daniel Borchmann
     (https://github.com/exot) for reporting.)
   • Predicate ‘src’’s matching of begin/end block lines, normalization
     of arguments, and handling in non-sexp queries.  (Thanks to Akira
     Komamura (https://github.com/akirak) for reporting.)
   • Predicate ‘src’’s behavior with various arguments.
   • Various compilation warnings.

   *Internal*
   • Certain query predicates, when called multiple times in an ‘and’
     sub-expression, are optimized to a single call.
   • Use ‘buffer-chars-modified-tick’ instead of ‘buffer-modified-tick’.
     (Thanks to Ihor Radchenko (https://github.com/yantar92).)
   • Implemented tests for ‘src’ predicate.

   *Updated*
   • Compatibility with new macro names in Transient.  (#269

File: README.info,  Node: 06,  Next: 052,  Prev: 061,  Up: Changelog

5.18 0.6
========

*Added*
   • Macro ‘org-ql-defpred’, used to define search predicates.  (See
     tutorial (examples/defpred.org).)
   • Predicate ‘effort’.
   • Predicate ‘heading-regexp’, which matches regular expressions
     against heading text (alias: ‘h*’).
   • Timestamp-related predicates now accept an optional ‘:with-time’
     argument, which allows matching timestamps with or without times
     (i.e.  HH:MM).
   • Sorting methods:
        • ‘reverse’
        • ‘closed’ (Thanks to Ryan Ye (https://github.com/yejianye).)
   • Dynamic block column ‘closed’.  (Thanks to Ryan Ye
     (https://github.com/yejianye).)
   • Abbreviate filenames in bookmarks.  (Thanks to Akira Komamura
     (https://github.com/akirak).)

   *Changed*
   • The order in which sorting functions is applied has been reversed.
     For example, ‘:sort '(todo priority date)’ now does what ‘:sort
     '(date priority todo)’ did in earlier versions.  (This change is
     made to enable the new ‘reverse’ sorting method.)  Users who have
     customized ‘org-ql-views’ will need to update the stored views’
     sorting methods to preserve the desired sort order.
   • Helm support (including the command ‘helm-org-ql’) has been moved
     to a separate package, ‘helm-org-ql’.
   • Predicate ‘heading’ now matches plain strings instead of regular
     expressions.
   • Update ‘dash’ dependency, and remove dependency on obsolete
     ‘dash-functional’.  (Fixes #179
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/179), #209
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/209).  Thanks to Mark
     Hudnall (https://github.com/landakram), Akira Komamura
     (https://github.com/akirak), Nathanael kinfe
     (https://github.com/natask), Pablo Stafforini
     (https://github.com/benthamite), Jason May
     (https://github.com/jmay), and Basil L.  Contovounesios
     (https://github.com/basil-conto).)

   *Removed*
   • Obsolete macro ‘org-ql’ (obsolete since 0.5, replaced by functions
     ‘org-ql-select’ and ‘org-ql-query’).

   *Fixed*
   • Timestamp-related predicates called with relative-date arguments
     did not properly invalidate the query cache.  (Fixes #223
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/223).  Thanks to Ihor
     Radchenko (https://github.com/yantar92) for reporting.)

   *Internal*
   • Predicates are now defined more cleanly with a macro
     (‘org-ql-defpred’) that consolidates functionality related to each
     predicate.  This will also allow users to more easily define custom
     predicates.
   • Version 1.0 of library ‘peg’ is now required.
   • Improvements to how arguments to timestamp-related predicates are
     processed.
   • Predicate normalizers are now applied repeatedly until a query is
     fully normalized.  (Normalizers should be written with this in mind
     to avoid infinite loops.)

5.19 0.5.2

*Fixed*
   • Predicate ‘link’’s ‘:target’ and ‘:regexp-p’ arguments.  (#220

     disappear after refreshing an ‘org-ql-search’ buffer.  (#186

File: README.info,  Node: 05,  Next: 049,  Prev: 051,  Up: Changelog

5.21 0.5
========

*Added*
   • View dispatcher using ‘transient.el’ (like Magit), bound to ‘v’ in
     search/view buffers.
   • Predicate ‘link’, which matches descriptions and targets in Org
     links.
   • Predicate ‘tags-regexp’ (alias: ‘tags*’), which matches regexps
     against entry tags (e.g, helpful when a tag might end in "s").
   • Emacs bookmark support: Org QL View buffers can be bookmarked with,
     e.g.  ‘C-x r m’ and shown with, e.g.  ‘C-x r b’.  (This also
     enables view restoration with Burly
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el).)
   • Dynamic block support.
   • Org link support (storing and opening links to Org QL View
     searches).
   • Mascot.

   *Changed*
   • Binding to refresh search/view buffers changed to ‘r’.

   *Internal*
   • When formatting entries for Org QL View buffers, use internal
     function for retrieving heading tags.  This improves speed by using
     our cache, and it removes the need for a compatibility alias for
     Org versions before 9.3.

   *Deprecated*
   • Macro ‘org-ql’ is marked obsolete.  It will be removed in v0.7.
     Functions ‘org-ql-select’ and ‘org-ql-query’ should be used
     instead.  (The macro serves only to confuse with regard to quoting
     arguments.)

5.31 0.4
========

_Note:_ The next release, 0.5, may include changes which will require
minor updates to written queries (e.g.  a few predicates may be
renamed).  Users who wish to avoid those changes happening unexpectedly
in their configs should avoid upgrading ‘org-ql’ beyond 0.4
automatically, as they will be pushed to the ‘master’ branch when ready.

   *Added*
   • *Commands*
        • ‘helm-org-ql-views’, which shows one of ‘org-ql-views’
          selected with Helm.
        • ‘org-ql-search’ can search files in ‘org-directory’;
          customization options are available in the ‘org-ql-search’
          group.
        • ‘org-ql-view-refresh’ can be called with a prefix argument to
          adjust search parameters.
   • *Queries*
        • Negation of terms in plain queries using ‘!’.  For example,
          ‘tags:space !moon’ to exclude entries which contain ‘moon’.
        • Predicates ‘outline-path’ (alias ‘olp’) and
          ‘outline-path-segment’ (alias ‘olps’).
        • Predicate ‘src’, which matches Org Babel source blocks.
        • Predicates ‘parent’ and ‘ancestors’.  (Thanks to Josh
          Moller-Mara (https://github.com/mm--).)
        • Alias ‘h’ for ‘heading’ predicate.
        • Alias ‘r’ for ‘regexp’ predicate.  (Thanks to Feng Shu
          (https://github.com/tumashu).)
   • Info manual.
   • Function ‘helm-org-ql-source’, which returns a Helm source that
     searches given buffers/files with ‘helm-org-ql’.  It can be used
     for custom Helm commands that search certain files.
   • Display a message when views are refreshed.  (Thanks to xeijin
     (https://github.com/xeijin).)
   • Respect Org Agenda restriction in ‘org-ql-block’.  (Thanks to Ihor
     Radchenko (https://github.com/yantar92) for reporting.)
   • Option ‘org-ql-view-sidebar-sort-views’.
   • Mouseover ‘help-echo’ text for ‘org-ql-views’ default view names.
   • "Dangling tasks" default view in ‘org-ql-views’.  (Users who have
     modified ‘org-ql-views’ from the default will not see the new view
     unless they copy it into their config.)

   *Changed*
   • Some default ‘org-ql-view’ views (users who have modified
     ‘org-ql-views’ from the default will not see the new views unless
     they copy them into their config):
        • Rename some views.
        • "Stuck projects" view (now uses ‘descendants’ instead of
          ‘children’, which is more useful.

   *Fixed*
   • Inherit file tags when ‘org-tag-inheritance’ is enabled.  (Fixes
     #55 (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/55).  Thanks to
     Mikhail Skorzhinskiy (https://github.com/mskorzhinskiy).)
   • Call ‘helm-make-source’ directly instead of using
     ‘helm-build-sync-source’ macro.  (Fixes #60
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/60).  Thanks to Matt
     Huszagh (https://github.com/matthuszagh) for reporting.)
   • Search/view buffers now always end with a newline, which prevents
     side-scrolling of the window when calling ‘end-of-buffer’.
   • Face for done to-do keywords in ‘org-ql-view’ buffers.  (Thanks to
     Yiming Chen (https://github.com/dsdshcym).)
   • Make view buffers read-only.  (Fixes #72
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/72).  Thanks to xeijin
     (https://github.com/xeijin).)
   • Sorting with single sorter specified as an atom.  (Thanks to Jeff

File: README.info,  Node: 03,  Next: 023,  Prev: 031,  Up: Changelog

5.34 0.3
========

*Added*
   • Alternative, non-sexp query syntax for commands ‘org-ql-search’ and
     ‘helm-org-ql’.  See .
   • Command ‘helm-org-ql’.
   • Command ‘org-ql-sparse-tree’, like ‘org-sparse-tree’ for ‘org-ql’
     queries.  (Thanks to Akira Komamura (https://github.com/akirak).)
   • Command ‘org-ql-view-sidebar’.
   • Per-buffer, per-heading tag caching, which increases the speed of
     tags-related queries by 6-7x.
   • More tags-related predicates and aliases:
        • For inherited tags: ‘tags-inherited’, ‘inherited-tags’,
          ‘tags-i’, ‘itags’.
        • For heading-local tags: ‘tags-local’, ‘local-tags’, ‘tags-l’,
          ‘ltags’.
        • ‘tags-all’, ‘tags&’: Matches all given tags using boolean
          ‘AND’ (rather than boolean ‘OR’, which the ‘tags’ predicate
          uses).
   • Variable ‘org-ql-block-header’, which overrides the default header
     in ‘org-ql-block’ agenda blocks.
   • Predicate ‘(path)’.
   • Option ‘org-ql-views’ may now be customized in a guided, structured
     way with the customization UI (e.g.  ‘M-x customize-option RET
     org-ql-views RET’, or press ‘c’ in the ‘org-ql-view-sidebar’
     buffer).
   • Enable more Org Agenda commands in ‘org-ql-view’ buffers (e.g.
     setting deadlines and scheduling).  (Fixes #35
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/35).  Thanks to Milan
     Zamazal (https://github.com/mz-pdm) and Mikhail Skorzhinskii
     (https://github.com/mskorzhinskiy).)
   • Function ‘org-ql-select’’s ‘buffers-files’ argument can be a
     function which returns a list of buffers and/or files.

   *Changed*
   • Predicate ‘heading’ now accepts multiple regexps, which are matched
     with boolean ‘AND’.
   • Predicate ‘regexp’ now matches its regexp arguments with boolean
     ‘AND’.
   • Package ‘org-super-agenda’ is now a dependency.  This removes the
     need for awkward code to handle the case where it’s not installed,
     and makes grouping features always available.  Of course, the
     global minor mode ‘org-super-agenda-mode’ is not activated by
     ‘org-ql’, so no behavior is changed in Org Agenda or ‘org-ql’; it
     only means that commands like ‘org-ql-search’ will always provide
     grouping when called with the appropriate arguments.

   *Removed*
   • Macro ‘org-ql-agenda’.  Instead, use function ‘org-ql-search’.  See
     also command ‘org-ql-view’, etc.

   *Fixed*
   • Predicate ‘heading’ now matches only against heading text, i.e.
     not including tags at the end of the line, to-do keyword, etc.
   • Predicate ‘todo’ now matches case-sensitively, avoiding
     non-todo-keyword matches (e.g.  a heading which begins ‘Waiting on’
     will no longer match for a todo keyword ‘WAITING’).
   • Interactive completion in ‘org-ql-search’.

   *Internal*
   • Refactored code from file ‘org-ql-agenda.el’ into files
     ‘org-ql-search.el’ and ‘org-ql-view.el’.  Function and variable
     names have been changed accordingly.

5.35 0.2.3
==========

*Fixed*
   • Priority queries could fail to match headings whose to-do keywords
     had non-alphabetic characters, like ‘TO-READ’.


File: README.info,  Node: 022,  Next: 021,  Prev: 023,  Up: Changelog

5.36 0.2.2
==========

*Fixed*
   • ‘(deadline auto)’ selector matched entries whose deadlines had a
     warning period that had not yet been entered
     (‘org-deadline-warning-days’ too soon).


File: README.info,  Node: 021,  Next: 02,  Prev: 022,  Up: Changelog

5.37 0.2.1
==========

*Fixed*
   • ‘(descendants)’ selector matched against parent heading instead of
     only descendants.


File: README.info,  Node: 02,  Next: 01,  Prev: 021,  Up: Changelog

5.38 0.2
========

*Added*
   • Function ‘org-ql-query’, like ‘org-ql-select’ but with arguments
     named more like a SQL query.
   • Bare strings like ‘"string"’ can be used in queries, which are
     converted to ‘(regexp "string")’ automatically.
   • Selector ‘(regexp)’ accepts multiple regexps to test.
   • Macro ‘org-ql’ and functions ‘org-ql-query’ and ‘org-ql-select’ now
     also accept a comparator function in their ‘:sort’ argument.
   • Function ‘org-ql-block’, which works as an Org Agenda
     series/composite/block command, usable in custom agenda commands
     defined in variable ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  (Inspired by
     Benson Chu’s config
     (https://github.com/pestctrl/emacs-config/blob/84c557982a860e86d6f67976a82ea776a7bd2c7a/config-org-new.org#my-own-agenda-renderer).)
   • Function ‘org-ql-agenda--agenda’ optionally takes a list of entries
     as an argument.
   • Selectors ‘ts-a’ and ‘ts-i’, aliases for ‘ts-active’ and
     ‘ts-inactive’.
   • Selector ‘ts’ now accepts a ‘:type’ argument.
   • Face ‘org-ql-agenda-due-date’.
   • Selectors ‘(children)’ and ‘(descendants)’.
   • Function ‘org-ql-search’ and macro ‘org-ql-agenda’ accept a
     ‘:title’ argument, which is displayed in the header.
   • Command ‘org-ql-search’ offers global ‘org-super-agenda-groups’ in
     completion.
   • Customization group ‘org-ql’.
   • Command ‘org-ql-view’, which displays views saved to variable
     ‘org-ql-views’, which can be saved from ‘org-ql-search’ buffers
     with command ‘org-ql-search-save’, which is bound to ‘C-x C-s’ in
     view buffers.
   • Variable ‘org-ql-view-map’, active in view buffers displayed by
     ‘org-ql-search’, ‘org-ql-agenda’, and ‘org-ql-view’.
   • ‘random’ sort method.
   • Save position when refreshing search buffers.

   *Changed*
   • Function ‘org-ql-query’ renamed to ‘org-ql-select’.  ‘org-ql-query’
     now refers to a new function.
   • Macro ‘org-ql’ no longer accepts a ‘:markers’ argument.  Instead,
     use argument ‘:action element-with-markers’.  See function
     ‘org-ql-select’, which ‘org-ql’ calls.
   • Selector ‘(todo)’ no longer matches "done" keywords when used
     without arguments (i.e.  the ones in variable ‘org-done-keywords’).
   • Overhauled date/time-based predicates.  See documentation for new
     argument signatures.

   *Removed*
   • Selector ‘(date)’, replaced by ‘(ts)’.

   *Fixed*
   • Handle date ranges in date-based selectors.  (Thanks to Cody
     Goodman (https://github.com/codygman), Samuel W.  Flint
     (https://github.com/swflint), and Vikas Rawal
     (https://github.com/vikasrawal).)
   • Don’t overwrite bindings in ‘org-agenda-mode-map’.
   • Don’t search buffers without headings, and show a message if the
     user attempts it.
   • Don’t search hidden/special buffers.
   • Properly accept arbitrary sort functions in ‘org-ql-select’, etc.
     (Fixes #37 (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/37).  Thanks
     to Milan Zamazal (https://github.com/mz-pdm).)
   • Planning-line-related predicates searched too far into entries.
   • Add autoloads.  (Fixes #36
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/pull/36/files#).  Thanks to
     Akira Komamura (https://github.com/akirak).)

   *Compatibility*
   • Fixes for compatibility with Org 9.2.  (Thanks to Ataias Pereira
     Reis (https://github.com/ataias) and Daniel Kraus
     (https://github.com/dakra).)

   *Internal*
   • Optimizations for some query selectors, e.g.  ‘regexp’ and ‘todo’.
     These can provide a significant improvement for some queries.  See
     benchmarks in notes.org (notes.org).
   • Library ts (https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el) is now used for
     parsing and comparing timestamps.

6.1 Copyright assignment
========================

While Org QL is currently distributed in MELPA, it’s intended
(https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/409) to merge Org QL into
Org mode.  When that happens, it will become a part of Emacs and Org,
and therefore cumulative contributions of more than 15 lines of code
will require that the author assign copyright of such contributions to
the FSF.  Authors who are interested in doing so may contact
assign@gnu.org <assign@gnu.org> to request the appropriate form.

7.1 Comparison with Org Agenda searches
=======================================

Of course, queries like these can already be written with Org Agenda
searches, but the syntax can be complex.  For example, this query would
be difficult to write in a standard Org Agenda search, because it
matches against a to-do keyword _and_ a plain-text search.  As described
in the advanced searching tutorial
(https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html#combining-metadata-and-full-text-queries),
it would require using ‘org-search-view’ with a query with specific
regular expression syntax, like this:

     +lisp +{^\*+\s-+TO-READ\s-}

   But with ‘org-ql-search’, you would write a query like ‘lisp
todo:TO-READ’, or in Lisp syntax, ‘(and "lisp" (todo "TO-READ"))’.
