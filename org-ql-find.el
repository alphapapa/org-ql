;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a way to quickly find and go to Org entries
;; selected with Emacs's built-in completions API (so it works with
;; packages that extend it, like Vertico, Marginalia, etc).  It works
;; like `helm-org-ql' but does not require Helm.

command that saves the user from having to type it).

QUERY-FILTER may be a function through which the query the user
types is filtered before execution (e.g. it could replace spaces

treated as multiple predicates, into multiple arguments to a
single predicate).
