;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a way to quickly find and go to Org entries
;; selected with Emacs's built-in completions API (so it works with
;; packages that extend it, like Vertico, Marginalia, etc).  It works
;; like `helm-org-ql' but does not require Helm.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

(require 'org)
(require 'org-ql)

Interactively, with universal prefix, select multiple buffers to
search with completion.

QUERY-PREFIX may be a string to prepend to the query (e.g. use
\"heading:\" to only search headings, easily creating a custom
command that saves the user from having to type it).

QUERY-FILTER may be a function through which the query the user
types is filtered before execution (e.g. it could replace spaces
with commas to turn multiple tokens, which would normally be
treated as multiple predicates, into multiple arguments to a
single predicate)."
