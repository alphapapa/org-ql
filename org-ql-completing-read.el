QUERY-PREFIX may be a string to prepend to the query entered by
the user (e.g. use \"heading:\" to only search headings, easily
creating a custom command that saves the user from having to type
it).

QUERY-FILTER may be a function through which the query the user
types is filtered before execution (e.g. it could replace spaces
with commas to turn multiple tokens, which would normally be
treated as multiple predicates, into multiple arguments to a
single predicate)."
