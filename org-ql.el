;;; Commentary:

;; `org-ql' is a Lispy query language for Org files.  It allows you to
;; find Org entries matching certain criteria and return a list of
;; them or perform actions on them.  Commands are also provided which
;; display a buffer with matching results, similar to an Org Agenda
;; buffer.

;;;;; Timestamp regexps

;; We need more specificity than the built-in Org timestamp regexps

;; MAYBE: Add match groups corresponding to the ones in the "official" Org regexps.
;; TODO: Use these new regexps in more places.

  "Return items matching QUERY in BUFFERS-OR-FILES.

BUFFERS-OR-FILES is a file or buffer, a list of files and/or
buffers, or a function which returns such a list.

QUERY is an `org-ql' query sexp (quoted, since this is a
function).

ACTION is a function which is called on each matching entry with
point at the beginning of its heading.  It may be:

- `element' or nil: Equivalent to `org-element-headline-parser'.

- `element-with-markers': Equivalent to calling
  `org-element-headline-parser', with markers added using
  `org-ql--add-markers'.  Suitable for formatting with
  `org-ql-view--format-element', allowing insertion into an Org
  Agenda-like buffer.

- A sexp, which will be byte-compiled into a lambda function.

- A function symbol.

If NARROW is non-nil, buffers are not widened (the default is to
widen and search the entire buffer).

SORT is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or
a list of defined `org-ql' sorting methods (`date', `deadline',
`scheduled', `closed', `todo', `priority', `reverse', or `random'); or a
user-defined comparator function that accepts two items as
arguments and returns nil or non-nil.  Sorting methods are
applied in the order given (i.e. later methods override earlier
ones), and `reverse' may be used more than once.

For example, `(date priority)' would present items with the
highest priority first, and within each priority the oldest items
would appear first.  In contrast, `(date reverse priority)' would
also present items with the highest priority first, but within
each priority the newest items would appear first."

(cl-defmacro org-ql-defpred (name args docstring &key body preambles normalizers coalesce)
  "Define an `org-ql' selector predicate named `org-ql--predicate-NAME'.
NAME may be a symbol or a list of symbols: if a list, the first
is used as NAME and the rest are aliases.  A function is only
created for NAME, not for aliases, so a normalizer should be used
to replace aliases with NAME in queries (keep reading).

ARGS is a `cl-defun'-style argument list.  DOCSTRING is the
function's docstring.

BODY is the body of the predicate.  It will be evaluated with
point on the beginning of an Org heading and should return
non-nil if the heading's entry is a match.

PREAMBLES and NORMALIZERS are lists of `pcase' forms matched
against Org QL query sexps.  They are spliced into `pcase' forms
in the definitions of the functions `org-ql--query-preamble' and
`org-ql--normalize-query', which see.  Those functions are
redefined when this macro is expanded, unless variable
`org-ql-defpred-defer' is non-nil, in which case those functions
should be redefined manually after defining predicates by calling
`org-ql--define-query-preamble-fn' and `org-ql--define-normalize-query-fn'.

NORMALIZERS are used to normalize query expressions to standard
forms.  For example, when the predicate has aliases, the aliases
should be replaced with predicate names using a normalizer.
Also, predicate arguments may be put into a more optimal form so
that the predicate has less work to do at query time.  NOTE:
Normalizers are applied to a query repeatedly until the query is
fully normalized, so normalizers should be carefully written to
avoid infinite loops.

PREAMBLES refer to regular expressions which may be used to
search through a buffer directly to a potential match rather than
testing the predicate body on each heading.  (Naming things is
hard.)  In each `pcase' form in PREAMBLES, the `pcase'
expression (not the pattern) should be a plist with the following
keys, each value of which should be an expression which may refer
to variables bound in the pattern:

  :regexp     Regular expression which searches directly to a
              potential match.

  :case-fold  Bound to `case-fold-search' around the regexp search.

  :query      Expression which should replace the query expression,
              or `query' if it should not be changed (e.g. if the
              regexp is insufficient to determine whether a
              heading matches, in which case the predicate's body
              needs to be tested on the heading).  If the regexp
              guarantees a match, this may be simply t, leaving the
              query expression with no work to do, which improves
              performance.

When COALESCE is t, multiple calls to this predicate within a
boolean AND query clause may be combined into a single call to
this predicate (so it is expected that this predicate treats
multiple arguments as being boolean AND'ed together; if it does
not, then it should not be set to coalesce).

This argument may also be a function called to do coalescing of
two predicate expressions.  It is called with two arguments: the
list of already-coalesced arguments to an expression, and the
list of arguments to the call being coalesced (note that a
query's arguments are normalized before the query is coalesced).
If it returns nil, the expression is not coalesced; otherwise, it
should return a new list of arguments coalescing the given
arguments, with new arguments being first.  (Using a
predicate-specific function to coalesce arguments is useful when,
e.g. a predicate takes keyword arguments, so arguments to
multiple calls can't be simply appended.)

For convenience, within the `pcase' patterns, the symbol
`predicate-names' is a special form which is replaced with a
pattern matching any of the predicate's name and aliases.  For
example, if NAME were:

  (heading h)

Then if NORMALIZERS were:

  ((`(,predicate-names . ,args)
  `(heading ,@args)))

It would be expanded to:

  ((`(,(or 'heading 'h) . ,args)
  `(heading ,@args)))"

;; searching ancestors, so executing a full query in that case can be faster due to use of
;; the "preambles" provided by running a full query.  However, see note below.
