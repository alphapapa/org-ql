;;;; Dynamic blocks

;; This section implements support for Org dynamic blocks.  See Info node `(org)Dynamic blocks'.

(require 'org-table)

(cl-defun org-dblock-write:org-ql (params)
  "Insert content for org-ql dynamic block at point according to PARAMS.
Valid parameters include:

  :query    An Org QL query expression in either sexp or string
            form.

  :columns  A list of columns, including `heading', `todo',
            `property',`priority',`deadline',`scheduled',`closed'.
            Each column may also be specified as a list with the
            second element being a header string.  For example,
            to abbreviate the priority column: (priority \"P\").
            For certain columns, like `property', arguments may
            be passed by specifying the column type itself as a
            list.  For example, to display a column showing the
            values of a property named \"milestone\", with the
            header being abbreviated to \"M\":

              ((property \"milestone\") \"M\").

  :sort     One or a list of Org QL sorting methods
            (see `org-ql-select').

  :take     Optionally take a number of results from the front (a
            positive number) or the end (a negative number) of
            the results.

  :ts-format  Optional format string used to format
              timestamp-based columns.

For example, an org-ql dynamic block header could look like:

  #+BEGIN: org-ql :query (todo \"UNDERWAY\") :columns (priority todo heading) :sort (priority date) :ts-format \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\""
