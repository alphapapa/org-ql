* Usage

The functionality provided may be grouped by:

+  Interactive commands :: ~org-ql-search~
+  Non-interactive functions and macros :: ~org-ql~ (macro), ~org-ql-query~ (function), and ~org-ql-agenda~ (macro)

Alternatively, they may be grouped by:

+  Showing an agenda-like view :: ~org-ql-search~ (command), and ~org-ql-agenda~ (macro)
+  Returning a list of matches or acting on them :: ~org-ql~ (macro), and ~org-ql-query~ (function)

Feedback on these APIs is welcome.  Eventually, after being tested and polished, they will be considered stable.

** Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      ignore-children
:END:

*** org-ql-search

The command =org-ql-search= prompts for a query, a list of buffers or files, and how to group and sort results.  Without prefix, it searches the current buffer instead of prompting.  Then it presents the results in an agenda-like view.

[[images/org-ql-search.gif]]

Here's an example of using it to generate an agenda-like view for certain files in a directory tree:

[[images/org-ql-search-snippet.png]]

** Queries

A query is a lisp form which may contain arbitrary lisp forms, as well as certain built-in predicates.  It is byte-compiled into a predicate function which is tested with point on each heading in an Org buffer; when it returns non-nil, the heading matches the query.

*** Predicates

Arguments are listed next to predicate names, where applicable.

Note that, for convenience, standard numeric comparator function symbols (~<~, ~=~, etc.) do not need to be quoted when passed as an argument to these predicates.  The resemblance to infix notation is coincidental.  See examples in documentation.

+  ~category (&optional categories)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading is in one or more of ~CATEGORIES~ (a list of strings).
+  ~clocked (&key from to on)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry was clocked in given period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry was clocked at any time.  If ~FROM~, return non-nil if entry was clocked on or after ~FROM~.  If ~TO~, return non-nil if entry was clocked on or before ~TO~.  If ~ON~, return non-nil if entry was clocked on date ~ON~.  ~FROM~, ~TO~, and ~ON~ should be strings parseable by ~parse-time-string~ but may omit the time value.  Note: Clock entries are expected to be clocked out.  Currently clocked entries (i.e. with unclosed timestamp ranges) are ignored.
+  ~closed (&optional comparator target-date)~ :: Return non-nil if entry's closed date compares with ~TARGET-DATE~ using ~COMPARATOR~.  ~TARGET-DATE~ should be a string parseable by ~date-to-day~.  ~COMPARATOR~ should be a function (like ~<=~).
+  ~deadline (&optional comparator target-date)~ :: Return non-nil if entry's deadline compares with ~TARGET-DATE~ using ~COMPARATOR~.  ~TARGET-DATE~ should be a string parseable by ~date-to-day~.  ~COMPARATOR~ should be a function (like ~<=~).
+  ~done~ :: Return non-nil if entry's ~TODO~ keyword is in ~org-done-keywords~.
+  ~habit~ :: Return non-nil if entry is a habit.
+  ~heading (regexp)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry's heading matches ~REGEXP~ (a regexp string).
+  ~level (level-or-comparator &optional level)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading's outline level matches ~LEVEL~ with ~COMPARATOR~.  If ~LEVEL~ is nil, ~LEVEL-OR-COMPARATOR~ should be an integer level, which will be tested for equality to the heading's outline level.  If ~LEVEL~ is non-nil, ~LEVEL-OR-COMPARATOR~ should be a comparator function (like ~<=~).
+  ~planning (&optional comparator target-date)~ :: Return non-nil if entry's planning date (deadline or scheduled) compares with ~TARGET-DATE~ using ~COMPARATOR~.  ~TARGET-DATE~ should be a string parseable by ~date-to-day~.  ~COMPARATOR~ should be a function (like ~<=~).
+  ~priority (&optional comparator-or-priority priority)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading has a certain priority.  ~COMPARATOR-OR-PRIORITY~ should be either a comparator function, like ~<=~, or a priority string, like "A" (in which case (~=~ will be the comparator).  If ~COMPARATOR-OR-PRIORITY~ is a comparator, ~PRIORITY~ should be a priority string.
+  ~property (property &optional value)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry has ~PROPERTY~ (a string), and optionally ~VALUE~ (a string).
+  ~regexp (regexp)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry matches ~REGEXP~ (a regexp string).
+  ~scheduled (&optional comparator target-date)~ :: Return non-nil if entry's scheduled date compares with ~TARGET-DATE~ using ~COMPARATOR~.  ~TARGET-DATE~ should be a string parseable by ~date-to-day~.  ~COMPARATOR~ should be a function (like ~<=~).
+  ~tags (&optional tags)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading has one or more of ~TAGS~ (a list of strings).
+  ~todo (&optional keywords)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading is a ~TODO~ item.  With ~KEYWORDS~, return non-nil if its keyword is one of ~KEYWORDS~ (a list of strings).
+  ~ts (&key from to on)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry has a timestamp in given period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry has any timestamp.  If ~FROM~, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on or after ~FROM~.  If ~TO~, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on or before ~TO~.  If ~ON~, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on date ~ON~.  ~FROM~, ~TO~, and ~ON~ should be strings parseable by ~parse-time-string~ but may omit the time value.
+  ~ts-active (&key from to on)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry has an active timestamp in given period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry has any active timestamp.  If ~FROM~, return non-nil if entry has an active timestamp on or after ~FROM~.  If ~TO~, return non-nil if entry has an active timestamp on or before ~TO~.  If ~ON~, return non-nil if entry has an active timestamp on date ~ON~.  ~FROM~, ~TO~, and ~ON~ should be strings parseable by ~parse-time-string~ but may omit the time value.
+  ~ts-inactive (&key from to on)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry has an inactive timestamp in given period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry has any inactive timestamp.  If ~FROM~, return non-nil if entry has an inactive timestamp on or after ~FROM~.  If ~TO~, return non-nil if entry has an inactive timestamp on or before ~TO~.  If ~ON~, return non-nil if entry has an inactive timestamp on date ~ON~.  ~FROM~, ~TO~, and ~ON~ should be strings parseable by ~parse-time-string~ but may omit the time value.

*** Agenda-like views

**** Macro: ~org-ql-agenda~

This macro is like ~org-ql~, but it presents matching entries in an Agenda-like view.  It's compatible with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]], which provides grouping.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-ql-agenda "~/src/emacs/org-super-agenda/test/test.org"
    (and (or (date = today)
             (deadline <=)
             (scheduled <= today))
         (not (done)))
    ;; The `org-super-agenda-groups' setting is used automatically when set, or it
    ;; may be overriden by specifying it here:
    :super-groups ((:name "Bills"
                          :tag "bills")
                   (:todo ("SOMEDAY" "TO-READ" "CHECK" "TO-WATCH" "WATCHING")
                          :order 7)
                   (:name "Personal"
                          :habit t
                          :tag "personal"
                          :order 3)
                   (:todo "WAITING"
                          :order 6)
                   (:priority "A" :order 1)
                   (:priority "B" :order 2)
                   (:priority "C" :order 2)))
#+END_SRC

Which presents this buffer:

[[images/screenshot.png]]

*Note:* The view buffer is currently put in ~org-agenda-mode~, which means that /some/ Org Agenda commands work, such as jumping to entries and changing item priorities (without necessarily updating the view).  This feature is experimental and not guaranteed to work correctly with all commands.  (It works to the extent it does because the appropriate text properties are placed on each item, imitating an Agenda buffer.)

Here are some other examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Show an agenda-like view of items in "~/org/main.org" with TODO and SOMEDAY keywords which are
  ;; tagged "computer" or "Emacs" and in the category "main":
  (org-ql-agenda "~/org/main.org"
    (and (todo "TODO" "SOMEDAY")
         (tags "computer" "Emacs")
         (category "main")))

  ;; Show an agenda-like view of all habits in all agenda files:
  (org-ql-agenda
    (habit))

  ;; Show an agenda-like view similar to a "traditional" Org agenda.
  (org-ql-agenda
    (or (habit)
        (date = today)
        (deadline <=)
        (scheduled <= today)
        (and (todo "DONE" "CANCELLED")
             (closed = today))))
#+END_SRC

*** Listing / acting-on results

**** Function: ~org-ql-query~

/Arguments:/ ~(buffers-or-files query &key action narrow sort)~

Return items matching ~QUERY~ in ~BUFFERS-OR-FILES~.

~BUFFERS-OR-FILES~ is a one (or a list of) file(s) or buffer(s).

~QUERY~ is an ~org-ql~ query sexp (quoted, since this is a function).

~ACTION~ is a function which is called on each matching entry, with point at the beginning of its heading.  For example, ~org-element-headline-parser~ may be used to parse an entry into an Org element (note that it must be called with a limit argument, so a lambda must be used to do so).  Also see ~org-ql--add-markers~, which may be used to add markers compatible with Org Agenda code.

If ~NARROW~ is non-nil, buffers are not widened.

~SORT~ is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or a list of defined ~org-ql~ sorting methods: ~date~, ~deadline~, ~scheduled~, ~todo~, and ~priority~.

**** Macro: ~org-ql~

/Arguments:/ ~(buffers-or-files query &key sort narrow markers action)~

Find entries in ~BUFFERS-OR-FILES~ that match ~QUERY~, and return the results of running ~ACTION-FN~ on each matching entry.

~BUFFERS-OR-FILES~ is a form which should evaluate to one (or a list of) file(s) or buffer(s).

~QUERY~ is an ~org-ql~ query sexp, unquoted.

~ACTION~ is a sexp which will be evaluated at each matching entry with point at the beginning of its heading.  It is passed to ~org-ql-query~ as a lambda.  By default, ~org-element-headline-parser~ is called to return an Org element.

~SORT~ is a user defined sorting function, or an unquoted list of one or more sorting methods, including: ~date~, ~deadline~, ~scheduled~, ~todo~, and ~priority~.

If ~NARROW~ is non-nil, query will run without widening the buffer (the default is to widen and search the entire buffer).

If ~MARKERS~ is non-nil, ~org-agenda-ng--add-markers~ is used to add markers to each item, pointing to the item in its source buffer.  In this case, ~ACTION~ should return an Org element.

** Comparison with Org Agenda searches

Of course, queries like these can already be written with Org Agenda searches, but the syntax can be complex.  For example, this query would be difficult to write in a standard Org Agenda search, because it matches against a to-do keyword /and/ a plain-text search.  As described in the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html#combining-metadata-and-full-text-queries][advanced searching tutorial]], it would require using ~org-search-view~ with a query with specific regular expression syntax, like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  +lisp +{^\*+\s-+TO-READ\s-}
#+END_EXAMPLE

But with ~org-ql-agenda~, you would write:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-ql-agenda
    (and (regexp "lisp")
         (todo "TO-READ")))
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Use async

If ~org-ql~ is loaded byte-compiled, the argument lists are not named properly (not sure why, as ~help-function-arglist~ is supposed to handle that).  We could run the function in another Emacs process with ~async~ to avoid this.
